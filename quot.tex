\section{Introduction}
\label{section-introduction}

\noindent
The purpose of this chapter is to write about Quot and Hilbert functors
and to prove that these are algebraic spaces provided certain technical
conditions are satisfied. In this chapter we will discuss this in the
setting of algebraic space. A reference is Grothendieck's lectures, see
\cite{Gr-I},
\cite{Gr-II},
\cite{Gr-III},
\cite{Gr-IV},
\cite{Gr-V}, and
\cite{Gr-VI}.
Another reference is the paper \cite{OS}, allthough this paper discusses
the more general case of Quot and Hilbert spaces associated to a morphism
of algebraic stacks which we will discuss in another chapter, see
(insert future reference here).

\medskip\noindent
In the case of Hilbert spaces there is a more general notion of
``Hilbert stacks'' which we will discuss in a separate chapter, see
(insert future reference here).



\section{Conventions}
\label{section-conventions}

\noindent
The standing assumption is that all schemes are contained in
a big fppf site $\textit{Sch}_{fppf}$. And all rings $A$ considered
have the property that $\text{Spec}(A)$ is (isomorphic) to an
object of this big site.

\medskip\noindent
Let $S$ be a scheme and let $X$ be an algebraic space over $S$.
In this chapter and the following we will write $X \times_S X$
for the product of $X$ with itself (in the category of algebraic
spaces over $S$), instead of $X \times X$.



\section{When is a morphism an isomorphism?}
\label{section-when-isomorphism}


\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-where-unramified}
Consider a commutative diagram
$$
\xymatrix{
X \ar[rr]_f \ar[rd]_p & & Y \ar[ld]^q \\
& Z
}
$$
of algebraic spaces. Assume that $p$ is locally of finite type and closed.
Then there exists an open subspace $W \subset Z$
such that a morphism $Z' \to Z$ factors through $W$ if and only if the
base change $f_{Z'} : X_{Z'} \to Y_{Z'}$ is unramified.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
By
Morphisms of Spaces, Lemma \ref{spaces-morphisms-lemma-where-unramified}
there exists an open subspace $U(f) \subset X$ which is the set of
points where $f$ is unramified. Moreover, formation of $U(f)$ commutes
with arbitrary base change. Let $W \subset Z$ be the open subspace
(see
Properties of Spaces, Lemma
\ref{spaces-properties-lemma-open-subspaces})
with underlying set of points
$$
|W| = |Z| \setminus |p|\left(|X| \setminus |U(f)|\right)
$$
i.e., $z \in |Z|$ is a point of $W$ if and only if $f$ is unramified
at every point of $X$ above $z$. Note that this is open because we
assumed that $p$ is closed. Since the formation of $U(f)$
commutes with arbitrary base change we immediately see (using
Properties of Spaces, Lemma
\ref{spaces-properties-lemma-factor-through-open-subspace})
that $W$ has the desired universal property.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-where-unramified-universally-injective}
Consider a commutative diagram
$$
\xymatrix{
X \ar[rr]_f \ar[rd]_p & & Y \ar[ld]^q \\
& Z
}
$$
of algebraic spaces. Assume hat
\begin{enumerate}
\item $p$ is locally of finite type,
\item $p$ is closed, and
\item $p_2 : X \times_Y X \to Z$ is closed.
\end{enumerate}
Then there exists an open subspace $W \subset Z$
such that a morphism $Z' \to Z$ factors through $W$ if and only if the
base change $f_{Z'} : X_{Z'} \to Y_{Z'}$ is unramified and universally
injective.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
After replacing $Z$ by the open subspace found in
Lemma \ref{lemma-where-unramified}
we may assume that $f$ is already unramified; note that this does not
destroy assumption (2) or (3). By
Morphisms of Spaces, Lemma
\ref{spaces-morphisms-lemma-diagonal-unramfied-morphism}
we see that $\Delta_{X/Y} : X \to X \times_Y X$ is an open immersion.
This remains true after any base change. Hence by
Morphisms of Spaces, Lemma
\ref{spaces-morphisms-lemma-universally-injective}
we see that $f_{Z'}$ is universally injective if and only if
the base change of the diagonal $X_{Z'} \to (X \times_Y X)_{Z'}$
is an isomorphism. Let $W \subset Z$ be the open subspace
(see
Properties of Spaces, Lemma
\ref{spaces-properties-lemma-open-subspaces})
with underlying set of points
$$
|W| = |Z| \setminus
|p_2|\left(|X \times_Y X| \setminus \text{Im}(|\Delta_{X/Y}|)\right)
$$
i.e., $z \in |Z|$ is a point of $W$ if and only if the fibre of
$|X \times_Y X| \to |Z|$ over $z$ is in the image of
$|X| \to |X \times_Y X|$. Then it is clear from the discussion above
that the restriction $p^{-1}(W) \to q^{-1}(W)$ of $f$ is
unramified and universally injective.

\medskip\noindent
Conversely, suppose that $f_{Z'}$ is unramified and universally injective.
In order to show that $Z' \to Z$ factors through $W$ it suffices to show
that $|Z'| \to |Z|$ has image contained in $|W|$, see
Properties of Spaces, Lemma
\ref{spaces-properties-lemma-factor-through-open-subspace}.
Hence it suffices to prove the result when $Z'$ is the spectrum of a field.
Denote $z \in |Z|$ the image of $|Z'| \to |Z|$. The discussion above shows
that
$$
|X_{Z'}| \longrightarrow |(X \times_Y X)_{Z'}|
$$
is surjective. By
Properties of Spaces, 
Lemma \ref{spaces-properties-lemma-points-cartesian}
in the commutative diagram
$$
\xymatrix{
|X_{Z'}| \ar[d] \ar[r] &
|(X \times_Y X)_{Z'}| \ar[d] \\
|p|^{-1}(\{z\}) \ar[r] &
|p_2|^{-1}(\{z\})
}
$$
the vertical arrows are surjective. It follows that $z \in |W|$ as desired.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-where-closed-immersion}
Consider a commutative diagram
$$
\xymatrix{
X \ar[rr]_f \ar[rd]_p & & Y \ar[ld]^q \\
& Z
}
$$
of algebraic spaces. Assume that
\begin{enumerate}
\item $p$ is locally of finite type,
\item $p$ is universally closed, and
\item $q : Y \to Z$ is separated.
\end{enumerate}
Then there exists an open subspace $W \subset Z$
such that a morphism $Z' \to Z$ factors through $W$ if and only if the
base change $f_{Z'} : X_{Z'} \to Y_{Z'}$ is a closed immersion.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
We will use the characterization of closed immersions as
universally closed, unramified, and universally injective morphisms, see
More on Morphisms of Algebraic Spaces, Lemma
\ref{spaces-more-morphisms-lemma-characterize-closed-immersion}.
First, note that since $p$ is universally closed and $q$ is
separated, we see that $f$ is universally closed, see
Morphisms of Spaces, Lemma
\ref{spaces-morphisms-lemma-universally-closed-permanence}.
It follows that any base change of $f$ is universally closed, see
Morphisms of Spaces, Lemma
\ref{spaces-morphisms-lemma-base-change-universally-closed}.
Thus to finish the proof of the lemma it suffices to prove that
the assumptions of
Lemma \ref{lemma-where-unramified-universally-injective}
are satisfied. The projection $\text{pr}_0 : X \times_Y X \to X$
is universally closed as a base change of $f$, see
Morphisms of Spaces, Lemma
\ref{spaces-morphisms-lemma-base-change-universally-closed}.
Hence $X \times_Y X \to Z$ is universally closed as
a composition of universally closed morphisms (see
Morphisms of Spaces, Lemma
\ref{spaces-morphisms-lemma-composition-universally-closed}).
This finishes the proof of the lemma.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-where-flat}
Consider a commutative diagram
$$
\xymatrix{
X \ar[rr]_f \ar[rd]_p & & Y \ar[ld]^q \\
& Z
}
$$
of algebraic spaces. Assume that
\begin{enumerate}
\item $p$ is locally of finite presentation,
\item $p$ is flat,
\item $p$ is closed, and
\item $q$ is locally of finite type.
\end{enumerate}
Then there exists an open subspace $W \subset Z$
such that a morphism $Z' \to Z$ factors through $W$ if and only if the
base change $f_{Z'} : X_{Z'} \to Y_{Z'}$ is flat.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
By
More on Morphisms of Spaces, Lemma
\ref{spaces-more-morphisms-lemma-base-change-flatness-fibres}
the set
$$
A = \{x \in |X| : X\text{ flat at }x \text{ over }Y\}.
$$
is open in $|X|$ and its formation commutes with arbitrary base
change. Let $W \subset Z$ be the open subspace
(see
Properties of Spaces, Lemma
\ref{spaces-properties-lemma-open-subspaces})
with underlying set of points
$$
|W| = |Z| \setminus |p|\left(|X| \setminus A\right)
$$
i.e., $z \in |Z|$ is a point of $W$ if and only if the whole fibre
of $|X| \to |Z|$ over $z$ is contained in $A$. This is open because
$p$ is closed. Since the formation of $A$ commutes with arbitrary
base change it follows that $W$ works.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-where-surjective-flat}
Consider a commutative diagram
$$
\xymatrix{
X \ar[rr]_f \ar[rd]_p & & Y \ar[ld]^q \\
& Z
}
$$
of algebraic spaces. Assume that
\begin{enumerate}
\item $p$ is locally of finite presentation,
\item $p$ is flat,
\item $p$ is closed,
\item $q$ is locally of finite type, and
\item $q$ is closed.
\end{enumerate}
Then there exists an open subspace $W \subset Z$
such that a morphism $Z' \to Z$ factors through $W$ if and only if the
base change $f_{Z'} : X_{Z'} \to Y_{Z'}$ is surjective and flat.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
By
Lemma \ref{lemma-where-flat}
we may assume that $f$ is flat.
Note that $f$ is locally of finite presentation by
Morphisms of Spaces,
Lemma \ref{spaces-morphisms-lemma-finite-presentation-permanence}.
Hence $f$ is open, see
Morphisms of Spaces, Lemma \ref{spaces-morphisms-lemma-fppf-open}.
Let $W \subset Z$ be the open subspace (see
Properties of Spaces, Lemma
\ref{spaces-properties-lemma-open-subspaces})
with underlying set of points
$$
|W| = |Z| \setminus |q|\left(|Y| \setminus |f|(|X|)\right).
$$
in other words for $z \in |Z|$ we have $z \in |W|$ if and only
if the whole fibre of $|Y| \to |Z|$ over $z$ is in the image of
$|X| \to |Y|$. Since $q$ is closed this set is open in $|Z|$.
The morphism $X_W \to Y_W$ is surjective by construction.
Finally, suppose that $X_{Z'} \to Y_{Z'}$ is surjective.
In order to show that $Z' \to Z$ factors through $W$ it suffices to show
that $|Z'| \to |Z|$ has image contained in $|W|$, see
Properties of Spaces, Lemma
\ref{spaces-properties-lemma-factor-through-open-subspace}.
Hence it suffices to prove the result when $Z'$ is the spectrum of a field.
Denote $z \in |Z|$ the image of $|Z'| \to |Z|$. By
Properties of Spaces, 
Lemma \ref{spaces-properties-lemma-points-cartesian}
in the commutative diagram
$$
\xymatrix{
|X_{Z'}| \ar[d] \ar[r] &
|Y_{Z'}| \ar[d] \\
|p|^{-1}(\{z\}) \ar[r] &
|q|^{-1}(\{z\})
}
$$
the vertical arrows are surjective. It follows that $z \in |W|$ as desired.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-where-isomorphism}
Consider a commutative diagram
$$
\xymatrix{
X \ar[rr]_f \ar[rd]_p & & Y \ar[ld]^q \\
& Z
}
$$
of algebraic spaces. Assume that
\begin{enumerate}
\item $p$ is locally of finite presentation,
\item $p$ is flat,
\item $p$ is universally closed,
\item $q$ is locally of finite type,
\item $q$ is closed, and
\item $q$ is separated.
\end{enumerate}
Then there exists an open subspace $W \subset Z$
such that a morphism $Z' \to Z$ factors through $W$ if and only if the
base change $f_{Z'} : X_{Z'} \to Y_{Z'}$ is an isomorphism.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
By
Lemma \ref{lemma-where-surjective-flat}
there exists an open subspace $W_1 \subset Z$ such that
$f_{Z'}$ is surjective and flat if and only if $Z' \to Z$
factors through $W_1$. By
Lemma \ref{lemma-where-closed-immersion}
there exists an open subspace $W_2 \subset Z$ such that
$f_{Z'}$ is a closed immersion if and only if $Z' \to Z$
factors through $W_2$. We claim that $W = W_1 \cap W_2$ works.
Certainly, if $f_{Z'}$ is an isomorphism, then $Z' \to Z$
factors through $W$. Hence it suffices to show that
$f_W$ is an isomorphism. By construction $f_W$ is a
surjective flat closed immersion. In particular $f_W$ is
representable. Since a surjective flat closed immersion of
schemes is an isomorphism (see
Morphisms, Lemma \ref{morphisms-lemma-characterize-flat-closed-immersions})
we win. (Note that actually $f_W$ is locally of finite presentation,
whence open, so you can avoid the use of this lemma if you like.)
