\section{Introduction}
\label{section-introduction}

\noindent
The purpose of this chapter is to write about Quot and Hilbert functors
and to prove that these are algebraic spaces provided certain technical
conditions are satisfied. Some information about these can be found
in Grothendieck's lectures, see
\cite{Gr-I},
\cite{Gr-II},
\cite{Gr-III},
\cite{Gr-IV},
\cite{Gr-V}, and
\cite{Gr-VI}.
Another reference is the paper \cite{OS}.

\medskip\noindent
In the case of Hilbert spaces there is a more general notion of
Hilbert stacks which we will discuss in a separate chapter, see
(insert future reference here).


\section{Conventions}
\label{section-conventions}

\noindent
We will use the conventions and abuse of language as in
Properties of Stacks, \ref{stacks-properties-section-conventions}.



\section{When is a morphism an isomorphism?}
\label{section-when-isomorphism}


\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-where-unramified}
Consider a commutative diagram
$$
\xymatrix{
X \ar[rr]_f \ar[rd]_p & & Y \ar[ld]^q \\
& Z
}
$$
of algebraic spaces. Assume that $p$ is locally of finite type and closed.
Then there exists an open subspace $W \subset Z$
such that a morphism $Z' \to Z$ factors through $W$ if and only if the
base change $f_{Z'} : X_{Z'} \to Y_{Z'}$ is unramified.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
By
Morphisms of Spaces, Lemma \ref{spaces-morphisms-lemma-where-unramified}
there exists an open subspace $U(f) \subset X$ which is the set of
points where $f$ is unramified. Moreover, formation of $U(f)$ commutes
with arbitrary base change. Let $W \subset Z$ be the open subspace
(see
Properties of Spaces, Lemma
\ref{spaces-properties-lemma-open-subspaces})
with underlying set of points
$$
|W| = |Z| \setminus |p|\left(|X| \setminus |U(f)|\right)
$$
i.e., $z \in |Z|$ is a point of $W$ if and only if $f$ is unramified
at every point of $X$ above $z$. Note that this is open because we
assumed that $p$ is closed. Since the formation of $U(f)$
commutes with arbitrary base change we immediately see (using
Properties of Spaces, Lemma
\ref{spaces-properties-lemma-factor-through-open-subspace})
that $W$ has the desired universal property.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-where-unramified-universally-injective}
Consider a commutative diagram
$$
\xymatrix{
X \ar[rr]_f \ar[rd]_p & & Y \ar[ld]^q \\
& Z
}
$$
of algebraic spaces. Assume hat
\begin{enumerate}
\item $p$ is locally of finite type,
\item $p$ is closed, and
\item $p_2 : X \times_Y X \to Z$ is closed.
\end{enumerate}
Then there exists an open subspace $W \subset Z$
such that a morphism $Z' \to Z$ factors through $W$ if and only if the
base change $f_{Z'} : X_{Z'} \to Y_{Z'}$ is unramified and universally
injective.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
After replacing $Z$ by the open subspace found in
Lemma \ref{lemma-where-unramified}
we may assume that $f$ is already unramified; note that this does not
destroy assumption (2) or (3). By
Morphisms of Spaces, Lemma
\ref{spaces-morphisms-lemma-diagonal-unramfied-morphism}
we see that $\Delta_{X/Y} : X \to X \times_Y X$ is an open immersion.
This remains true after any base change. Hence by
Morphisms of Spaces, Lemma
\ref{spaces-morphisms-lemma-universally-injective}
we see that $f_{Z'}$ is universally injective if and only if
$\Delta' : X_{Z'} \to (X \times_Y X)_{Z'}$ is an isomorphism.
Thus the solution of the problem posed in the lemma is to let
$W \subset Z$ be the open subspace
(see
Properties of Spaces, Lemma
\ref{spaces-properties-lemma-open-subspaces})
with underlying set of points
$$
|W| = |Z| \setminus
|p_2|\left(|X \times_Y X| \setminus \text{Im}(|\Delta_{X/Y}|)\right)
$$
i.e., $z \in |Z|$ is a point of $W$ if and only if the fibre of
$|X \times_Y X| \to |Z|$ over $z$ is in the image of
$|X| \to |X \times_Y X|$.
\end{proof}
