Some conventions I seem to be following while re-editing the bibliography:
* always use {}, no ""
* make sure to use -- dashes in pages
* write fields in caps
* use the biblatex way of JOURNAL and SHORTJOURNAL:
  if you decide not to use biblatex it's easy to change this)
* use EPRINT and EPRINTTYPE according to biblatex:
  this gives the best results, in case you decide to stick to bibtex it's
  easy to parse these
* AUTHOR is specified by the format "Family name, First name(s)", and
  whenever a second name is used it's spelt completely
* I haven't decided yet on an indentation format

While typing this I realize I haven't been making the types (the @book etc)
consistent. As the fields are in uppercase already, this might be uppercase
too, unless you disagree.
