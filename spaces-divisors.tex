\section{Introduction}
\label{section-introduction}

\noindent
In this chapter we study divisors on algebraic spaces and related topics.
A basic reference for algebraic spaces is \cite{Kn}.




\section{Effective Cartier divisors}
\label{section-effective-Cartier-divisors}

\noindent
For some reason it seem convenient to define the notion of an effective
Cartier divisor before anything else. Note that in
Morphisms of Spaces, Section \ref{spaces-morphisms-section-closed-immersions}
we discussed the correspondence between closed subspaces and quasi-coherent
sheaves of ideals. Moreover, in
Properties of Spaces, Section
\ref{spaces-properties-section-properties-modules}, we discussed properties
of quasi-coherent modules, in particular ``locally generated by $1$ element''.
These references show that the following definition is
compatible with the definition for schemes.

\begin{definition}
\label{definition-effective-Cartier-divisor}
Let $S$ be a scheme. Let $X$ be an algebraic space over $S$.
\begin{enumerate}
\item A {\it locally principal closed subspace} of $X$ is a closed subspace
whose sheaf of ideals is locally generated by $1$ element.
\item An {\it effective Cartier divisor} on $X$ is a closed subspace
$D \subset X$ such that the ideal sheaf $\mathcal{I}_D \subset \mathcal{O}_X$
is an invertible $\mathcal{O}_X$-module.
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

\noindent
Thus an effective Cartier divisor is a locally principal closed subspace,
but the converse is not always true. Effective Cartier divisors are closed
subspaces of pure codimension $1$ in the strongest possible sense. Namely
they are locally cut out by a single element which is not a zerodivisor.
In particular they are nowhere dense.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-characterize-effective-Cartier-divisor}
Let $S$ be a scheme. Let $X$ be an algebraic space over $S$.
Let $D \subset X$ be a closed subspace.
The following are equivalent:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The subspace $D$ is an effective Cartier divisor on $X$.
\item For some scheme $U$ and surjective \'etale morphism $U \to X$
the inverse image $D \times_X U$ is an effective Cartier divisor on $U$.
\item For every scheme $U$ and every \'etale morphism $U \to X$
the inverse image $D \times_X U$ is an effective Cartier divisor on $U$.
\item For every $x \in |D|$ there exists an \'etale morphism
$(U, u) \to (X, x)$ of pointed algebraic spaces such that $U = \Spec(A)$
and $D \times_X U = \Spec(A/(f))$ with $f \in A$ not a zerodivisor.
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
The equivalence of (1) -- (3) follows from
Definition \ref{definition-effective-Cartier-divisor}
and the references preceding it.
Assume (1) and let $x \in |D|$. Choose a scheme $W$ and a
surjective \'etale morphism
$W \to X$. Choose $w \in D \times_X W$ mapping to $x$.
By (3) $D \times_X W$ is an effective Cartier
divisor on $W$. Hence we can find affine \'etale neighbourhood $U$
by choosing an affine open neighbourhood of $w$ in $W$ as in
Divisors, Lemma \ref{divisors-lemma-characterize-effective-Cartier-divisor}.

\medskip\noindent
Assume (2). Then we see that $\mathcal{I}_D|_U$ is invertible by
Divisors, Lemma \ref{divisors-lemma-characterize-effective-Cartier-divisor}.
Since we can find an \'etale covering of $X$ by the collection of
all such $U$ and $X \setminus D$, we conclude that
$\mathcal{I}_D$ is an invertible $\mathcal{O}_X$-module.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-complement-locally-principal-closed-subscheme}
Let $S$ be a scheme. Let $X$ be an algebraic space over $S$.
Let $Z \subset X$ be a locally principal closed
subscheme. Let $U = X \setminus Z$. Then $U \to X$ is an affine morphism.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
The question is \'etale local on $X$, see
Morphisms of Spaces, Lemmas \ref{spaces-morphisms-lemma-affine-local}
and
Lemma \ref{lemma-characterize-effective-Cartier-divisor}.
Thus this follows from the case of schemes which is
Divisors, Lemma
\ref{divisors-lemma-complement-locally-principal-closed-subscheme}.
\end{proof}
