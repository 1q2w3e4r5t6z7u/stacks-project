\section{Introduction}
\label{section-introduction}

\noindent
This chapter is devoted to advanced topics on groupoids
in algebraic spaces.
Even though the results are stated in terms of groupoids in
algebraic spaces, the
reader should keep in mind the $2$-cartesian diagram
\begin{equation}
\label{equation-quotient-stack}
\vcenter{
\xymatrix{
R \ar[r] \ar[d] & U \ar[d] \\
U \ar[r] & [U/R]
}
}
\end{equation}
where $[U/R]$ is the quotient stack, see
Groupoids in Spaces, Remark \ref{spaces-groupoids-remark-fundamental-square}.
Many of the results are motivated by thinking about this diagram.
See for example the beautiful paper \cite{K-M} by Keel and Mori.





\section{Notation}
\label{section-notation}

\noindent
We continue to abide by the conventions and notation introduced in
Groupoids in Spaces, Section \ref{spaces-groupoids-section-notation}.





\section{Useful diagrams}
\label{section-diagrams}

\noindent
We briefly restate the results of
Groupoids in Spaces, Lemmas \ref{spaces-groupoids-lemma-diagram} and
\ref{spaces-groupoids-lemma-diagram-pull}
for easy reference in this chapter.
Let $S$ be a scheme. Let $B$ be an algebraic space over $S$.
Let $(U, R, s, t, c)$ be a groupoid in algebraic spaces over $B$.
In the commutative diagram
\begin{equation}
\label{equation-diagram}
\vcenter{
\xymatrix{
& U & \\
R \ar[d]_s \ar[ru]^t &
R \times_{s, U, t} R
\ar[l]^-{\text{pr}_0} \ar[d]^{\text{pr}_1} \ar[r]_-c &
R \ar[d]^s \ar[lu]_t \\
U & R \ar[l]_t \ar[r]^s & U
}
}
\end{equation}
the two lower squares are fibre product squares.
Moreover, the triangle on top (which is really a square)
is also cartesian.

\medskip\noindent
The diagram
\begin{equation}
\label{equation-pull}
\vcenter{
\xymatrix{
R \times_{t, U, t} R
\ar@<1ex>[r]^-{\text{pr}_1} \ar@<-1ex>[r]_-{\text{pr}_0}
\ar[d]_{\text{pr}_0 \times c \circ (i, 1)} &
R \ar[r]^t \ar[d]^{\text{id}_R} &
U \ar[d]^{\text{id}_U} \\
R \times_{s, U, t} R
\ar@<1ex>[r]^-c \ar@<-1ex>[r]_-{\text{pr}_0} \ar[d]_{\text{pr}_1} &
R \ar[r]^t \ar[d]^s &
U \\
R \ar@<1ex>[r]^s \ar@<-1ex>[r]_t &
U
}
}
\end{equation}
is commutative. The two top rows are isomorphic via the vertical maps given.
The two lower left squares are cartesian.







\section{Properties of groupoids}
\label{section-technical-lemma}

\noindent
This section is the analogue of
More on Groupoids, Section \ref{more-groupoids-section-technical-lemma}.
The reader is strongly encouraged to read that section first.

\medskip\noindent
The following lemma is the analogue of
More on Groupoids, Lemma \ref{more-groupoids-lemma-property-invariant}.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-property-invariant}
Let $B \to S$ be as in Section \ref{section-notation}.
Let $(U, R, s, t, c)$ be a groupoid in algebraic spaces over $B$.
Let $\tau \in \{fppf, \linebreak[0] etale,\linebreak[0] smooth,\linebreak[0]
syntomic\}$. Let $\mathcal{P}$ be a property of morphisms of algebraic spaces
which is $\tau$-local on the target
(Descent on Spaces,
Definition \ref{spaces-descent-definition-property-morphisms-local}).
Assume $\{s : R \to U\}$ and $\{t : R \to U\}$ are coverings for the
$\tau$-topology. Let $W \subset U$ be the maximal open subspace such that
$s^{-1}(W) \to W$ has property $\mathcal{P}$.
Then $W$ is $R$-invariant
(Groupoids in Spaces,
Definition \ref{spaces-groupoids-definition-invariant-open}).
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Consider the union $W_{set}$ of the images $g(|U'|) \subset |U|$ of
morphisms of algebraic spaces $g : U' \to U$ with the properties:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $g$ is flat of finite presentation, etale, smooth, or syntomic, and
\item the base change $s' : U' \times_{g, U, s} R \to U'$ has property
$\mathcal{P}$.
\end{enumerate}
Since each such morphism $g$ is open we see that $W_{set} \subset |U|$
is an open subset of $|U|$. Let $W \subset U$ denote the corresponding
open subspace, see
Properties of Spaces, Lemma \ref{spaces-properties-lemma-open-subspaces}.
Since $\mathcal{P}$ is local in the $\tau$ topology the
restriction of $s$ to $s^{-1}(W)$ has property $\mathcal{P}$.
This means the assertion of the lemma makes sense.
Next, consider the diagram in
Diagram (\ref{equation-diagram}).
Let $W_1 \subset R$ be the maximal open subspace over which the
second projection
$\text{pr}_1 : R \times_{s, U, t} R \to R$ has property $\mathcal{P}$.
(Note that $W_1$ exists by the same argument as above.)
By assumption the morphisms $t$, $s$ are
flat of finite presentation, etale, smooth, or syntomic, so they are
in particular open, see
Morphisms of Spaces, Lemma \ref{spaces-morphisms-lemma-fppf-open}.
Hence $W' = s(W_1)$ and $W'' = t(W_1)$ are open subspaces of $U$.
Moreover, $\{s|_{W_1} : W_1 \to W'\}$ and $\{t|_{W_1} : W_1 \to W''\}$
are $\tau$-coverings by our assumption that
$\{s : R \to U\}$ and $\{t : R \to U\}$ are $\tau$-coverings.
Since the two lower squares of 
Diagram (\ref{equation-diagram})
are cartesian we now conclude that
\begin{enumerate}
\item $s : R \to U$ has property $\mathcal{P}$ over $W'$,
\item $t : R \to U$ has property $\mathcal{P}$ over $W''$, and also
\item $\text{pr}_1 : R \times_{s, U, t} R \to R$ has property
$\mathcal{P}$ over $t^{-1}(W)$, and
\item $\text{pr}_1 : R \times_{s, U, t} R \to R$ has property
$\mathcal{P}$ over $s^{-1}(W)$.
\end{enumerate}
Clarification: The first two statements come from descending the property
through the coverings mentioned above, the second two by going up along the
coverings $\{s|_{s^{-1}(W)} : s^{-1}(W) \to W\}$ and
$\{t|_{t^{-1}(W)} : t^{-1}(W) \to W\}$.
All in all we conclude that
$W', W'' \subset W$ and $t^{-1}(W), s^{-1}(W) \subset W_1$. In other words
$W_1 = s^{-1}(W) = t^{-1}(W)$ as desired.
\end{proof}




\section{Comparing fibres}
\label{section-fibres}

\noindent
This section is the analogue of
More on Groupoids, Section \ref{more-groupoids-section-fibres}.
The reader is strongly encouraged to read that section first.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-two-fibres}
Let $B \to S$ be as in Section \ref{section-notation}.
Let $(U, R, s, t, c)$ be a groupoid in algebraic spaces over $B$.
Let $K$ be a field and let $r, r' : \text{Spec}(K) \to R$
be morphisms such that $t \circ r = t \circ r' : \text{Spec}(K) \to U$.
Set $u = s \circ r$, $u' = s \circ r'$ and denote
$F_u = \text{Spec}(K) \times_{u, U, s} R$ and
$F_{u'} = \text{Spec}(K) \times_{u', U, s} R$ the fibre products.
Then $F_u \cong F_{u'}$ as algebraic spaces over $K$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
We use the properties and the existence of
Diagram (\ref{equation-diagram}).
There exists a morphism $\xi : \text{Spec}(K) \to R \times_{s, U, t} R$
with $\text{pr}_0 \circ \xi = r$ and $c \circ \xi = r'$.
Let $\tilde r = \text{pr}_1 \circ \xi : \text{Spec}(K) \to R$.
Then looking at the bottom two squares of
Diagram (\ref{equation-diagram})
we see that both $F_u$ and $F_{u'}$ are identified with the algebraic space
$\text{Spec}(K) \times_{\tilde r, R, \text{pr}_1} (R \times_{s, U, t} R)$.
\end{proof}

\noindent
Actually, in the situation of the lemma the morphisms of pairs
$s : (R, r) \to (U, u)$ and $s : (R, r') \to (U, u')$ are
locally isomorphic in the $\tau$-topology, provided $\{s: R \to U\}$ is a
$\tau$-covering. We will insert a precise statement here if needed.




\section{The finite part of a morphism}
\label{section-finite}

\noindent
Let $S$ be a scheme.
Let $f : X \to Y$ be a morphism of algebraic spaces over $S$.
For an algebraic space or a scheme $T$ over $S$ consider pairs
$(a, Z)$ where
\begin{equation}
\label{equation-finite-conditions}
\begin{matrix}
a : T \to Y\text{ is a morphism over }S,\hfill \\
Z \subset T \times_Y X\text{ is an open subspace such that }
\text{pr}_0|_Z : Z \to T\text{ is finite.}
\end{matrix}
\end{equation}
Suppose $h : T' \to T$ is a morphism of algebraic spaces over $S$
and $(a, Z)$ is a pair over $T$. Set
$a' = a \circ h$ and $Z' = (h \times \text{id}_X)^{-1}(Z) = T' \times_T Z$.
Then the pair $(a', Z')$ satisfies (1), (2) over $T'$.
This follows as finite morphisms are preserved under base change, see
Morphisms of Spaces, Lemma \ref{spaces-morphisms-lemma-base-change-integral}.
Thus we obtain a functor
\begin{equation}
\label{equation-finite}
\begin{matrix}
(X/Y)_{fin} : &
(\textit{Sch}/S)^{opp} &
\longrightarrow &
\textit{Sets} \\
& T & \longmapsto &
\{(a, Z)\text{ as above}\}
\end{matrix}
\end{equation}
For applications we are mainly interested in this functor $(X/Y)_{fin}$
when $f$ is separated and locally of finite type. To get an idea
of what this is all about, take a look at
Remark \ref{remark-finite-quasi-finite-separated-morphism-schemes}.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-finite-sheaf}
Let $S$ be a scheme.
Let $f : X \to Y$ be a morphism of algebraic spaces over $S$.
Then we have
\begin{enumerate}
\item The presheaf $(X/Y)_{fin}$ satisfies the sheaf condition for
the fppf topology.
\item If $T$ is an algebraic space over $S$, then there is a
canonical bijection
$$
\text{Mor}_{\textit{Sh}((\textit{Sch}/S)_{fppf})}(T, (X/Y)_{fin})
=
\{(a, Z)\text{ satisfying \ref{equation-finite-conditions}}\}
$$
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Let $T$ be an algebraic space over $S$.
Let $\{T_i \to T\}$ be an fppf covering (by algebraic spaces).
Let $s_i = (a_i, Z_i)$ be pairs over $T_i$
satisfying \ref{equation-finite-conditions}
such that we have $s_i|_{T_i \times_T T_j} = s_j|_{T_i \times_T T_j}$.
First, this implies in particular that $a_i$ and $a_j$ define the same
morphism $T_i \times_T T_j \to Y$. By
Descent on Spaces,
Lemma \ref{spaces-descent-lemma-fppf-universal-effective-epimorphisms}
we deduce that there exists a unique morphism $a : T \to Y$
such that $a_i$ equals the composition $T_i \to T \to Y$.
Second, this implies that $Z_i \subset T_i \times_Y X$ are open subspaces
whose inverse images in $(T_i \times_T T_j) \times_Y X$ are equal.
Since $\{T_i \times_Y X \to T \times_Y X\}$ is an fppf covering
we deduce that there exists a unique open subspace $Z \subset T \times_Y X$
which restricts back to $Z_i$ over $T_i$, see
Descent on Spaces, Lemma \ref{spaces-descent-lemma-open-fpqc-covering}.
We claim that the projection $Z \to T$ is finite.
This follows as being finite is local for the fpqc topology, see
Descent on Spaces, Lemma \ref{spaces-descent-lemma-descending-property-finite}.

\medskip\noindent
Note that the result of the preceding paragraph in particular implies (1).

\medskip\noindent
Let $T$ be an algebraic space over $S$. In order to prove (2) we will
construct mutually inverse maps between the displayed sets. In the
following when we say ``pair'' we mean a pair satisfying
conditions \ref{equation-finite-conditions}.

\medskip\noindent
Let $v : T \to (X/Y)_{fin}$ be a natural transformation.
Choose a scheme $U$ and a surjective etale morphism $p : U \to T$.
Then $v(p) \in (X/Y)_{fin}(U)$ corresponds to a pair $(a_U, Z_U)$
over $U$. Let $R = U \times_T U$ with projections $t, s : R \to U$.
As $v$ is a transformation of functors we see that the pullbacks of
$(a_U, Z_U)$ by $s$ and $t$ agree. Hence, since $\{U \to T\}$ is an
fppf covering, we may apply the result of the first paragraph that
deduce that there exists a unique pair $(a, Z)$ over $T$.

\medskip\noindent
Conversely, let $(a, Z)$ be a pair over $T$. 
Let $U \to T$, $R = U \times_T U$, and $t, s : R \to U$ be as
above. Then the restriction $(a, Z)|_U$ gives rise to a
tranformation of functors $v : h_U \to (X/Y)_{fin}$ by the
Yoneda lemma
(Categories, Lemma \ref{categories-lemma-yoneda}).
As the two pullbacks $s^*(a, Z)|_U$ and $t^*(a, Z)|_U$
are equal, we see that $v$ coequalizes the two maps
$h_t, h_s : h_R \to h_U$. Since $T = U/R$ is the fppf quotient sheaf by
Spaces, Lemma \ref{spaces-lemma-space-presentation}
and since $(X/Y)_{fin}$ is an fppf sheaf by (1) we conclude
that $v$ factors through a map $T \to (X/Y)_{fin}$.

\medskip\noindent
We omit the verification that the two constructions above are mutually
inverse.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-finite-open}
Let $S$ be a scheme. Consider a commutative diagram
$$
\xymatrix{
X' \ar[rr]_j \ar[rd] & & X \ar[ld] \\
& Y
}
$$
of algebraic spaces over $S$. If $j$ is an open immersion, then
there is a canonical injective map of sheaves
$j : (X'/Y)_{fin} \to (X/Y)_{fin}$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
If $(a, Z)$ is a pair over $T$ for $X'/Y$, then
$(a, j(Z))$ is a pair over $T$ for $X/Y$.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-finite-lives-on-locally-quasi-finite-part}
Let $S$ be a scheme.
Let $f : X \to Y$ be a morphism of algebraic spaces over $S$ which is
locally of finite type.
Let $X' \subset X$ be the maximal open subspace over which $f$ is
locally quasi-finite, see
Morphisms of Spaces,
Lemma \ref{spaces-morphisms-lemma-locally-finite-type-quasi-finite-part}.
Then $(X/Y)_{fin} = (X'/Y)_{fin}$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Lemma \ref{lemma-finite-open}
gives us an injective map $(X'/Y)_{fin} \to (X/Y)_{fin}$.
Morphisms of Spaces,
Lemma \ref{spaces-morphisms-lemma-locally-finite-type-quasi-finite-part}
assures us that formation of $X'$ commutes with base change.
Hence everything comes down to proving that if
$Z \subset X$ is a open subspace such that $f|_Z : Z \to Y$ is finite,
then $Z \subset X'$. This is true because a finite morphism
is locally quasi-finite, see
Morphisms of Spaces, Lemma \ref{spaces-morphisms-lemma-finite-quasi-finite}.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-finite-separated}
Let $S$ be a scheme.
Let $f : X \to Y$ be a morphism of algebraic spaces over $S$.
Let $T$ be an algebraic space over $S$, and let $(a, Z)$ be
a pair as in \ref{equation-finite-conditions}.
If $f$ is separated, then $Z$ is closed in $T \times_Y X$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
A finite morphism of algebraic spaces is universally closed by
Morphisms of Spaces, Lemma \ref{spaces-morphisms-lemma-finite-proper}.
Since $f$ is separated so is the morphism $T \times_Y X \to T$, see
Morphisms of Spaces, Lemma \ref{spaces-morphisms-lemma-base-change-separated}.
Thus the closedness of $Z$ follows from
Morphisms of Spaces,
Lemma \ref{spaces-morphisms-lemma-universally-closed-permanence}.
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}
\label{remark-finite-monoid}
Let $f : X \to Y$ be a separated morphism of algebraic spaces.
The sheaf $(X/Y)_{fin}$ comes with a natural map
$(X/Y)_{fin} \to Y$ by mapping the pair $(a, Z) \in (X/Y)_{fin}(T)$
to the element $a \in Y(T)$. We can use
Lemma \ref{lemma-finite-separated}
to define operations
$$
\star_i : (X/Y)_{fin} \times_Y (X/Y)_{fin} \longrightarrow (X/Y)_{fin}
$$
by the rules
\begin{align*}
\star_1 : ((a, Z_1), (a, Z_2)) & \longmapsto (a, Z_1 \cup Z_2) \\
\star_2 : ((a, Z_1), (a, Z_2)) & \longmapsto (a, Z_1 \cap Z_2) \\
\star_3 : ((a, Z_1), (a, Z_2)) & \longmapsto (a, Z_1 \setminus Z_2) \\
\star_4 : ((a, Z_1), (a, Z_2)) & \longmapsto (a, Z_2 \setminus Z_1).
\end{align*}
The reason this works is that $Z_1 \cap Z_2$ is both open and closed
inside $Z_1$ and $Z_2$ (which also implies that $Z_1 \cup Z_2$ is
the disjoint union of the other three pieces).
Thus we can think of $(X/Y)_{fin}$ as an $\mathbf{F}_2$-algebras
(without unit) over $Y$ with multiplication given by
$ss' = \star_2(s, s')$, and addition given by
$$
s + s' = \star_1(\star_3(s, s'), \star_4(s, s'))
$$
which boils down to taking the symmetric difference.
Note that in this sheaf of algebras $0 = (1_Y, \emptyset)$
and that indeed $s + s = 0$ for any local section $s$.
If $f : X \to Y$ is finite, then this algebra has a unit namely
$1 = (1_Y, X)$ and $\star_3(s, s') = s(1 + s')$, and
$\star_4(s, s') = (1 + s)s'$.
\end{remark}

\begin{remark}
\label{remark-finite-quasi-finite-separated-morphism-schemes}
Let $f : X \to Y$ be a separated, locally quasi-finite
morphism of schemes. In this case the sheaf $(X/Y)_{fin}$
is closely related to the sheaf $f_!\mathbf{F}_2$
(insert future reference here) on $Y_{etale}$.
Namely, if $V \to Y$ is etale, and $s \in \Gamma(V, f_!\mathbf{F}_2)$,
then $s \in \Gamma(V \times_Y X, \mathbf{F}_2)$ is a section
with proper support $Z = \text{Supp}(s)$ over $V$. Since $f$ is
als locally quasi-finite we see that the projection $Z \to V$ is actually
finite. Since the support of a section of a constant abelian sheaf is open
we see that the pair $(V \to Y, \text{Supp}(s))$ satisfies
\ref{equation-finite-conditions}.
In fact, $f_!\mathbf{F}_2 \cong (X/Y)_{fin}|_{Y_{etale}}$
in this case which also explains the $\mathbf{F}_2$-algebra structure
introduced in Remark \ref{remark-finite-monoid}.
\end{remark}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-finite-diagonal}
Let $S$ be a scheme.
Let $f : X \to Y$ be a morphism of algebraic spaces over $S$.
The diagonal of $(X/Y)_{fin} \to Y$
$$
(X/Y)_{fin} \longrightarrow (X/Y)_{fin} \times_Y (X/Y)_{fin}
$$
is representable (by schemes) and an open immersion and the ``absolute''
diagonal
$$
(X/Y)_{fin} \longrightarrow (X/Y)_{fin} \times (X/Y)_{fin}
$$
is representable (by schemes).
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
The second statement follows from the first as the absolute diagonal
is the composition of the relative diagonal and a base change
of the diagonal of $Y$ (which is representable by schemes), see
Spaces, Section \ref{spaces-section-representable}.
To prove the first assertion we have to show the following:
Given a scheme $T$ and two pairs $(a, Z_1)$ and $(a, Z_2)$
with identical first component
satisfying \ref{equation-finite-conditions}
there is an open subscheme $V \subset T$ with the following
property: For any morphism of schemes $h : T' \to T$ we have
$$
h(T') \subset V \Leftrightarrow
\Big(T' \times_T Z_1 = T' \times_T Z_2
\text{ as subspaces of }T' \times_Y X\Big)
$$
Let us construct $V$. Note that $Z_1 \cap Z_2$ is open in $Z_1$
and in $Z_2$. Since $\text{pr}_0|_{Z_i} : Z_i \to T$ is finite,
hence proper (see
Morphisms of Spaces, Lemma \ref{spaces-morphisms-lemma-finite-proper})
we see that
$$
E =
\text{pr}_0|_{Z_1}\left(Z_1 \setminus Z_1 \cap Z_2)\right)
\cup
\text{pr}_0|_{Z_2}\left(Z_2 \setminus Z_1 \cap Z_2)\right)
$$
is closed in $T$. Now it is clear that $V = T \setminus E$ works.
\end{proof}
