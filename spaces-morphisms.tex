\section{Introduction}
\label{section-introduction}

\noindent
In this chapter we introduce some types of morphisms of algebraic spaces.
A reference is \cite{Kn}.



\section{Properties of representable morphisms}
\label{section-representable}

\noindent
Let $S$ be a scheme.
Let $f : X \to Y$ be a representable morphism of algebraic spaces. In
Spaces, Section \ref{spaces-section-representable-properties}
we defined what it means for $f$ to
have property $\mathcal{P}$ in case $\mathcal{P}$ is a property
of morphisms of schemes which
\begin{enumerate}
\item is preserved under any base change,
see Schemes, Definition \ref{schemes-definition-preserved-by-base-change},
and
\item is fppf local on the base, see
Descent, Definition \ref{descent-definition-property-morphisms-local}.
\end{enumerate}
Namely, in this case we say $f$ has property $\mathcal{P}$ if and only
if for every scheme $U$ and any morphism $U \to Y$ the morphism of schemes
$X \times_Y U \to U$ has property $\mathcal{P}$.

\medskip\noindent
According to the lists in
Spaces, Section \ref{spaces-section-lists}
this applies to the following properties:
(1)(a) closed immersions,
(1)(b) open immersions,
(1)(c) quasi-compact immersions,
(2) quasi-compact,
(3) universally-closed,
(4) (quasi-)separated,
(5) monomorphism,
(6) surjective,
(7) radicial (or universally injective),
(8) affine,
(9) quasi-affine,
(10) (locally) of finite type,
(11) (locally) quasi-finite,
(12) (locally) of finite presentation,
(13) locally of finite type of relative dimension $d$,
(14) universally open,
(15) flat,
(16) syntomic,
(17) smooth,
(18) unramified,
(19) etale,
(20) proper,
(21) finite or integral,
(22) finite locally free, and
(23) immersion.

\medskip\noindent
In this chapter we will redefine these notions for not necessarily
representable morphisms of algebraic spaces. Whenever we do this we will make
sure that the new definition agrees with the old one, in order to avoid
ambiguity.

\medskip\noindent
Note that the definition above applies whenever $X$ is a scheme,
since a morphism from a scheme to an algebraic space is representable.
And in particular it applies when both $X$ and $Y$ are schemes.
In Spaces, Lemma
\ref{spaces-lemma-morphism-schemes-gives-representable-transformation-property}
we have seen that in this case the definitions
match, and no ambiguity arise.

\medskip\noindent
Furthermore, in Spaces,
Lemma \ref{spaces-lemma-base-change-representable-transformations-property}
we have seen that the property of
representable morphisms of algebraic spaces so defined is stable under
arbitrary base change by a morphism of algebraic spaces.
And finally, in Spaces, Lemmas
\ref{spaces-lemma-composition-representable-transformations-property}
and
\ref{spaces-lemma-product-representable-transformations-property}
we have seen that if $\mathcal{P}$ is stable under compositions,
which holds for the properties
(1)(a), (1)(b), (1)(c), (2) -- (23), except (13) above, then
taking products of representable morphisms preserves property $\mathcal{P}$ 
and compositions of representable morphisms preserves property $\mathcal{P}$.

\medskip\noindent
We will use these facts below, and whenever we do we will simply refer
to this section as a reference.





\section{Immersions}
\label{section-immersions}

\noindent
Open, closed and locally closed immersions of algebraic spaces were defined in
Spaces, Section \ref{spaces-section-Zariski}.
Namely, such a morphism is by definition representable and has the
corresponding property as discussed in the previous section.

\medskip\noindent
In particular such a type of morphism is stable under base change,
composition and products of morphisms in the category of algebraic
spaces over $S$, see Section \ref{section-representable}.





\section{Quasi-compact morphisms}
\label{section-quasi-compact}

\noindent
By Section \ref{section-representable} we know what it means for
a representable morphism of algebraic spaces to be quasi-compact.
In order to formulate the definition for a general morphism
of algebraic spaces we make the following observation.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-characterize-representable-quasi-compact}
Let $S$ be a scheme.
Let $f : X \to Y$ be a representable morphism of algebraic spaces over $S$.
The following are equivalent:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $f$ is quasi-compact, and
\item for every quasi-compact algebraic space $Z$ and any morphism
$Z \to Y$ the algebraic space $Z \times_Y X$ is quasi-compact.
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Assume (1), and let $Z \to Y$ be a morphism of algebraic spaces with
$Z$ quasi-compact. By
Properties of Spaces,
Definition \ref{spaces-properties-definition-quasi-compact}
there exists a quasi-compact scheme $U$ and a surjective etale
morphism $U \to Z$. Since $f$ is representable and quasi-compact
we see by definition that $U \times_Y X$ is a scheme, and that
$U \times_Y X \to U$ is quasi-compact. Hence $U \times_Y X$ is
a quasi-compact scheme. The morphism $U \times_Y X \to Z \times_Y X$
is etale and surjective (as the base change of the representable
etale and surjective morphism $U \to Z$, see
Section \ref{section-representable}).
Hence by definition $Z \times_Y X$ is quasi-compact.

\medskip\noindent
Assume (2). Let $Z \to Y$ be a morphism, where $Z$ is a scheme.
We have to show that $p : Z \times_Y X \to Z$ is quasi-compact.
Let $U \subset Z$ be affine open. Then $p^{-1}(U) = U \times_Y Z$
and the scheme $U \times_Y Z$ is quasi-compact by assumption (2).
Hence $p$ is quasi-compact, see
Schemes, Section \ref{schemes-section-quasi-compact}.
\end{proof}

\noindent
This motivates the following definition.

\begin{definition}
\label{definition-quasi-compact}
Let $S$ be a scheme.
Let $f : X \to Y$ be a morphism of algebraic spaces over $S$.
We say $f$ is {\it quasi-compact} if for every quasi-compact
algebraic space $Z$ and morphism $Z \to Y$ the fibre product
$Z \times_Y X$ is quasi-compact.
\end{definition}

\noindent
By Lemma \ref{lemma-characterize-representable-quasi-compact}
above this agrees with the already existing notion
for representable morphisms of algebraic spaces.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-base-change-quasi-compact}
The base change of a quasi-compact morphism of algebraic spaces
by any morphism of algebraic spaces is quasi-compact.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Omitted.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-composition-quasi-compact}
The composition of a pair of quasi-compact morphisms of algebraic spaces
is quasi-compact.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Omitted.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-characterize-quasi-compact}
Let $S$ be a scheme.
Let $f : X \to Y$ be a morphism of algebraic spaces over $S$.
The following are equivalent:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $f$ is quasi-compact,
\item for every scheme $Z$ and any morphism $Z \to Y$ the morphism of
algebraic spaces $Z \times_Y X \to Z$ is quasi-compact,
\item for every affine scheme $Z$ and any morphism
$Z \to Y$ the algebraic space $Z \times_Y X$ is quasi-compact, and
\item there exists a scheme $V$ and a surjective etale morphism
$V \to Y$ such that $V \times_Y X \to V$ is a quasi-compact morphism
of algebraic spaces.
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
We will use Lemma \ref{lemma-base-change-quasi-compact}
without further mention.
It is clear that (1) implies (2) and that (2) implies (3).
Assume (3). Let $Z$ be a quasi-compact algebraic space over $S$,
and let $Z \to Y$ be a morphism. By
Properties of Spaces, Lemma
\ref{spaces-properties-lemma-quasi-compact-affine-cover}
there exists an affine scheme $U$ and a surjective etale morphism
$U \to Z$. Then $U \times_Y X \to Z \times_Y X$ is surjective and
etale. Hence by
Properties of Spaces, Lemma
\ref{spaces-properties-lemma-characterize-surjective}
the map $|U \times_Y X| \to |Z \times_Y X|$ is surjective.
By assumption $|U \times_Y X|$ is quasi-compact, so
we conclude that $|Z \times_Y X|$ is quasi-compact.
This proves that (3) implies (1).

\medskip\noindent
That (1) implies (4) is clear. Let $V \to Y$ be as in
condition (4). Let $Z$ be an
affine scheme, and let $Z \to Y$ be a morphism. Consider the diagram
$$
\xymatrix{
Z \times_Y V \ar[r] \ar[d] & V \ar[d] \\
Z \ar[r] & Y
}
$$
As the left vertical arrow is etale, hence open,
we can find a quasi-compact open $W \subset V \times_Y Z$ which
surjects onto $Z$. By assumption the space $W \times_V (V \times_Y X)$
is quasi-compact. Since $W \times_V (V \times_Y X) \to Z \times_Y X$
is surjective we conclude that $|Z \times_Y X|$ is quasi-compact as
before. Hence (3) holds.
\end{proof}




\section{Universally closed morphisms}
\label{section-universally-closed}

\noindent
Here is the natural definition.

\begin{definition}
\label{definition-universally-closed}
Let $S$ be a scheme. Let $f : X \to Y$ be a morphism of algebraic spaces
over $S$. We say $f$ is {\it universally closed} if for every morphism
of algebraic spaces $Z \to Y$ the morphism of topological spaces
$$
|Z \times_Y X| \to |Z|
$$
is closed.
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-base-change-universally-closed}
The base change of a universally closed morphism of algebraic spaces
by any morphism of algebraic spaces is universally closed.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
This is immediate from the definition.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-composition-universally-closed}
The composition of a pair of universally closed morphisms of algebraic spaces
is universally closed.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Omitted.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-characterize-universally-closed}
Let $S$ be a scheme. Let $f : X \to Y$ be a morphism of algebraic spaces
over $S$. The following are equivalent
\begin{enumerate}
\item $f$ is universally closed,
\item for every scheme $Z$ and every morphism $Z \to Y$
the projection $|Z \times_Y X| \to |Z|$ is closed,
\item for every affine scheme $Z$ and every morphism $Z \to Y$
the projection $|Z \times_Y X| \to |Z|$ is closed, and
\item there exists a scheme $V$ and a surjective etale morphism
$V \to Y$ such that $V \times_Y X \to V$ is a universally closed morpism
of algebraic spaces.
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
We omit the proof that (1) implies (2), and that (2) implies (3).

\medskip\noindent
Assume (3). Choose a surjective etale morphism $V \to Y$.
We are going to show that $V \times_Y X \to V$ is a universally
closed morpism of algebraic spaces. Let $Z \to V$ be a morphism
from an algebraic space to $V$. Let $W \to Z$ be a surjective etale
morphism where $W = \coprod W_i$ is a disjoint union of affine schemes, see
Properties of Spaces,
Lemma \ref{spaces-properties-lemma-cover-by-union-affines}.
Then we have the following commutative diagram
$$
\xymatrix{
\coprod_i |W_i \times_Y X| \ar@{=}[r] \ar[d] &
|W \times_Y X| \ar[r] \ar[d] &
|Z \times_Y X| \ar[d] \ar@{=}[r] &
|Z \times_V (V \times_Y X)| \ar[ld] \\
\coprod |W_i| \ar@{=}[r] &
|W| \ar[r] &
|Z|
}
$$
We have to show the south-east arrow is closed. The middle horizontal
arrows are surjective and open
(Properties of Spaces, Lemma \ref{spaces-properties-lemma-etale-open}).
By assumption (3), and the fact that
$W_i$ is affine we see that the left vertical arrows are closed. Hence
it follows that the right vertical arrow is closed.

\medskip\noindent
Assume (4). We will show that $f$ is universally closed.
Let $Z \to Y$ be a morphism of algebraic spaces. Consider the
diagram
$$
\xymatrix{
|(V \times_Y Z) \times_V (V \times_Y X)| \ar@{=}[r] \ar[rd] &
|V \times_Y X| \ar[r] \ar[d] &
|Z \times_Y X| \ar[d] \\
 &
|V \times_Y Z| \ar[r] &
|Z|
}
$$
The south-west arrow is closed by assumption. The horizontal arrows are
surjective and open because the corresponding morphisms of
algebraic spaces are etale (see
Properties of spaces, Lemma \ref{spaces-properties-lemma-etale-open}).
It follows that the right vertical arrow is closed.
\end{proof}

\begin{example}
\label{example-strange-universally-closed}
Strange example of a universally closed morphism.
Let $\mathbf{Q} \subset k$ be a field of characteristic zero.
Let $X = [\mathbf{A}^1_k/\mathbf{Z}]$ as in
Spaces, Example \ref{spaces-example-affine-line-translation}.
We claim the structure morphism $p : X \to \text{Spec}(k)$
is universally closed.
Namely, if $Z/k$ is a scheme, and $T \subset |X \times_k Z|$ is closed,
then $T$ corresponds to a $\mathbf{Z}$-invariant closed subset of
$T' \subset |\mathbf{A}^1 \times Z|$. It is easy to see that
this implies that $T'$ is the inverse image of a subset $T''$ of
$Z$. By
Morphisms, Lemma \ref{morphisms-lemma-fpqc-quotient-topology}
we have that $T'' \subset Z$ is closed.
Of course $T''$ is the image of $T$. Hence $p$ is universally
closed by Lemma \ref{lemma-characterize-universally-closed}.
\end{example}




\section{Valuative criteria}
\label{section-valuative}

\noindent
The formulation of the existence part of the valuative criterion is
slightly different for morphisms of algebraic spaces, since it may be
necessary to extend the fraction field of the valuation ring.
See Example, \ref{example-finite-separable-needed}. Here is the definition.

\begin{definition}
\label{definition-valuative-criterion}
Let $S$ be a scheme.
Let $f : X \to Y$ be a morphism of algebraic spaces over $S$.
We say $f$ {\it satisfies the uniqueness part of the valuative criterion}
if given any commutative solid diagram
$$
\xymatrix{
\text{Spec}(K) \ar[r] \ar[d] & X \ar[d] \\
\text{Spec}(A) \ar[r] \ar@{-->}[ru] & Y
}
$$
where $A$ is a valuation ring with field of fractions $K$, there exists
at most one dotted arrow (without requiring existence).
We say $f$ {\it satisfies the existence part of the valuative criterion}
if given any solid diagram as above there exists an extension
$K \subset K'$ of fields, a valuation ring $A' \subset K'$ dominating
$A$ and a morphism $\text{Spec}(A') \to X$ such that the following
diagram commutes
$$
\xymatrix{
\text{Spec}(K') \ar[r] \ar[d] & \text{Spec}(K) \ar[r] & X \ar[d] \\
\text{Spec}(A') \ar[r] \ar[rru] &\text{Spec}(A) \ar[r] & Y
}
$$
We say $f$ {\it satisfies the valuative criterion}
if $f$ satisfies both the existence and uniqueness part.
\end{definition}

\noindent
It turns out that for algebraic spaces, it always sufffices to
take a finite separable extension $K \subset K'$ above.
See Lemma \ref{lemma-finite-separable-enough}.
Before we prove it we show that the criterion
is identical to the criterion as formulated for morphisms of schemes
in case the morphism of algebraic spaces is representable.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-valuative-criterion-representable}
Let $S$ be a scheme.
Let $f : X \to Y$ be a morphism of algebraic spaces over $S$.
Assume $f$ is representable. The following are equivalent
\begin{enumerate}
\item $f$ satisfies the existence part of the valuation criterion
as in Definition \ref{definition-valuative-criterion} above, and
\item given any commutative solid diagram
$$
\xymatrix{
\text{Spec}(K) \ar[r] \ar[d] & X \ar[d] \\
\text{Spec}(A) \ar[r] \ar@{-->}[ru] & Y
}
$$
where $A$ is a valuation ring with field of fractions $K$, there exists
a dotted arrow, i.e., $f$ satisfies the existence part of the valuative
criterion as in
Schemes, Definition \ref{schemes-definition-valuative-criterion}.
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
It suffices to show that given a commutative diagram of the form
$$
\xymatrix{
\text{Spec}(K') \ar[r] \ar[d] & \text{Spec}(K) \ar[r] & X \ar[d] \\
\text{Spec}(A') \ar[r] \ar[rru]^\varphi &\text{Spec}(A) \ar[r] & Y
}
$$
as in Definition \ref{definition-valuative-criterion}, then we can
find a morphism $\text{Spec}(A) \to X$ fitting into the diagram too.
Set $X_A = \text{Spec}(A) \times_Y Y$. As $f$ is representable we see
that $X_A$ is a scheme. The morphism $\varphi$ gives a morphism
$\varphi' : \text{Spec}(A') \to X_A$. Let $x \in X_A$ be the image of
the closed point of $\varphi' : \text{Spec}(A') \to X_A$. Then we
have the following commutative diagram of rings
$$
\xymatrix{
K' & K \ar[l] & \mathcal{O}_{X_A, x} \ar[l] \ar[lld] \\
A' \ar[u] & A \ar[l] & A \ar[l] \ar[u]
}
$$
Since $A$ is a valuation ring, and since $A'$ dominates $A$, we see
that $K \cap A' = A$. Hence the ring map $\mathcal{O}_{X_A, x} \to K$
has image contained in $A$. Whence a morphism $\text{Spec}(A) \to X_A$ (see
Schemes, Section \ref{schemes-section-points})
as desired.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-finite-separable-enough}
Let $S$ be a scheme.
Let $f : X \to Y$ be a morphism of algebraic spaces over $S$.
The following are equivalent
\begin{enumerate}
\item $f$ satisfies the existence part of the valuation criterion
as in Definition \ref{definition-valuative-criterion}, and
\item $f$ satisfies the existence part of the valuation criterion
as in Definition \ref{definition-valuative-criterion} modified by
requiring the extension $K \subset K'$ to be finite separable.
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
We have to show that (1) implies (2). Suppose given a diagram
$$
\xymatrix{
\text{Spec}(K') \ar[r] \ar[d] & \text{Spec}(K) \ar[r] & X \ar[d] \\
\text{Spec}(A') \ar[r] \ar[rru] &\text{Spec}(A) \ar[r] & Y
}
$$
as in Definition \ref{definition-valuative-criterion} with $K \subset K'$
arbitrary. Choose a scheme $U$ and a surjective etale morphism $U \to X$.
Then
$$
\text{Spec}(A') \times_X U \longrightarrow \text{Spec}(A')
$$
is surjective etale. Let $p$ be a point of $\text{Spec}(A') \times_X U$
mapping to the closed point of $\text{Spec}(A')$. Let $p' \leadsto p$
be a generalization of $p$ mapping to the generic point of $\text{Spec}(A')$.
Such a generalization exists because generalizations lift along flat
morphisms of schemes, see
Morphisms, Lemma \ref{morphisms-lemma-generalizations-lift-flat}.
Then $p'$ corresponds to a point of the scheme $\text{Spec}(K') \times_X U$.
Note that
$$
\text{Spec}(K') \times_X U
=
\text{Spec}(K') \times_{\text{Spec}(K)} (\text{Spec}(K) \times_X U)
$$
Hence $p'$ maps to a point $q' \in \text{Spec}(K) \times_X U$ whose
residue field is a finite separable extension of $K$. Finally,
$p' \leadsto p$ maps to a specialization $u' \leadsto u$ on the
scheme $U$. With all this notation we get the following diagram of
rings
$$
\xymatrix{
\kappa(p') & & \kappa(q') \ar[ll] & \kappa(u') \ar[l] \\
& \mathcal{O}_{\text{Spec}(A') \times_X U, p} \ar[lu] & &
\mathcal{O}_{U, u} \ar[ll] \ar[u] \\
K' \ar[uu] & A' \ar[l] \ar[u] & A \ar[l] \ar'[u][uu]
}
$$
This means that the ring $B \subset \kappa(q')$ generated by
the images of $A$ and $\mathcal{O}_{U, u}$ maps to a subring
of $\kappa(p')$ contained in the image $B'$ of
$\mathcal{O}_{\text{Spec}(A') \times_X U, p} \to \kappa(p')$.
Note that $B'$ is a local ring. Let $\mathfrak m \subset B$
be the maximal ideal. By construction $A \cap \mathfrak m$,
(resp.\ $\mathcal{O}_{U, u} \cap \mathfrak m$, resp.\ $A' \cap \mathfrak m$)
is the maximal ideal of $A$ (resp.\ $\mathcal{O}_{U, u}$, resp.\ $A'$).
Set $\mathfrak q = B \cap \mathfrak m$. This is a
prime ideal such that $A \cap \mathfrak q$ is the maximal ideal of $A$.
Hence $B_{\mathfrak q} \subset \kappa(q')$ is a local ring dominating
$A$. By
Algebra, Lemma \ref{algebra-lemma-dominate}
we can find a valuation ring $A_1 \subset \kappa(q')$
with field of fractions $\kappa(q')$
dominating $B_{\mathfrak q}$. The (local) ring map
$\mathcal{O}_{U, u} \to A_1$ gives a morphism
$\text{Spec}(A_1) \to U \to X$
such that the diagram
$$
\xymatrix{
\text{Spec}(\kappa(q')) \ar[r] \ar[d] & \text{Spec}(K) \ar[r] & X \ar[d] \\
\text{Spec}(A_1) \ar[r] \ar[rru] &\text{Spec}(A) \ar[r] & Y
}
$$
is commutative. Since $f.f.(A_1) = \kappa(q') \supset K$ is finite
separable by construction the lemma is proved.
\end{proof}

\begin{example}
\label{example-finite-separable-needed}
Consider the algebraic space $X$ constructed in
Spaces, Example \ref{spaces-example-non-representable-descent}.
Recall that it is the affine line with zero doubled in a Galois twisted
relative to a degree two Galois extension $k \subset k'$.
As such it comes with a morphism
$$
\pi : X \longrightarrow S = \mathbf{A}^1_k
$$
which is quasi-compact. We claim that $\pi$ is universally closed.
Namely, after base change by $\text{Spec}(k') \to \text{Spec}(k)$
the morphism $\pi$ is identified with the morphism
$$
\text{affine line with zero doubled}
\longrightarrow
\text{affine line}
$$
which is universally closed (some details omitted). Since the morphism
$\text{Spec}(k') \to \text{Spec}(k)$ is universally closed and
surjective, a diagram chase shows that $\pi$ is universally closed.
On the other hand, consider the diagram
$$
\xymatrix{
\text{Spec}(k((x))) \ar[r] \ar[d] & X \ar[d]^\pi \\
\text{Spec}(k[[x]]) \ar[r] \ar@{..>}[ru] & \mathbf{A}^1_k
}
$$
Since the unique point of $X$ above $0 \in \mathbf{A}^1_k$
corresponds to a monomorphism $\text{Spec}(k') \to X$
it is clear there cannot exist a dotted arrow! This shows that
a finite separable field extension is needed in general.
\end{example}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-base-change-valuative-criteria}
The base change of a morphism of algebraic spaces which satisfies the
existence part of (resp.\ uniqueness part of) the valuative criterion
by any morphism of algebraic spaces satisfies the
existence part of (resp.\ uniqueness part of) the valuative criterion.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Let $f : X \to Y$ be a morphism of algebraic spaces over the scheme $S$.
Let $Z \to Y$ be any morphism of algebraic spaces over $S$.
Consider a solid commutative diagram of the following shape
$$
\xymatrix{
\text{Spec}(K) \ar[r] \ar[d] & Z \times_Y X \ar[r] \ar[d] & X \ar[d] \\
\text{Spec}(A) \ar[r] \ar@{-->}[ru] \ar@{-->}[rru] & Z \ar[r] & Y
}
$$
Then the set of north-west dotted arrows making the diagram commute
is in 1-1 correspondence with the set of west-north-west dotted arrows
making the diagram commute. This proves the lemma in the case of
``uniqueness''. For the existence part, assume $f$ satisfies the existence
part of the valuative criterion. If we are given a solid commutative
diagram as above, then by assumption there exists an extension $K \subset K'$
of fields and a valuation ring $A' \subset K'$ dominating $A$ and
a morphism $\text{Spec}(A') \to X$ fitting into the following commutative
diagram
$$
\xymatrix{
\text{Spec}(K') \ar[r] \ar[d] &
\text{Spec}(K) \ar[r] & Z \times_Y X \ar[r] & X \ar[d] \\
\text{Spec}(A') \ar[r] \ar[rrru] & \text{Spec}(A) \ar[r] & Z \ar[r] & Y
}
$$
And by the remarks above the skew arrow corresponds to an arrow
$\text{Spec}(A') \to Z \times_Y X$ as desired.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-composition-valuative-criteria}
The composition of two morphisms of algebraic spaces which satisfy the
(existence part of, resp.\ uniqueness part of) the valuative criterion
satisfies the (existence part of, resp.\ uniqueness part of) the valuative
criterion.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Let $f : X \to Y$, $g : Y \to Z$ be morphisms of algebraic spaces over the
scheme $S$. Consider a solid commutative diagram of the following shape
$$
\xymatrix{
\text{Spec}(K) \ar[dd] \ar[r] & X \ar[d]^f \\
& Y \ar[d]^g \\
\text{Spec}(A) \ar[r] \ar@{-->}[ru] \ar@{-->}[ruu] & Z
}
$$
If we have the uniqueness part for $g$, then there exists at
most one north-west dotted arrow making the diagram commute.
If we also have the uniqueness part for $f$, then we have
at most one north-north-west dotted arrow making the diagram
commute. The proof in the existence case comes from contemplating
the following diagram
$$
\xymatrix{
\text{Spec}(K'') \ar[r] \ar[dd] &
\text{Spec}(K') \ar[r] &
\text{Spec}(K) \ar[r] &
X \ar[d]^f \\
& & & Y \ar[d]^g \\
\text{Spec}(A'') \ar[r] \ar[rrruu] &
\text{Spec}(A') \ar[r] \ar[rru] &
\text{Spec}(A) \ar[r] &
Z
}
$$
Namely, the existence part for $g$ gives us the extension $K'$, the
valuation ring $A'$ and the arrow $\text{Spec}(A') \to Y$, whereupon
the existence part for $f$ gives us the extension $K''$, the
valuation ring $A''$ and the arrow $\text{Spec}(A'') \to X$.
\end{proof}






\section{Valuative criterion for universal closedness}
\label{section-valuative-criterion-universally-closed}

\noindent
This is a little more involved than in the case of schemes, especially
since the most optimistic guess is wrong. See discussion below.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-quasi-compact-existence-universally-closed}
Let $S$ be a scheme.
Let $f : X \to Y$ be a morphism of algebraic spaces over $S$.
Assume
\begin{enumerate}
\item $f$ is quasi-compact, and
\item $f$ satisfies the existence part of the valuative criterion.
\end{enumerate}
Then $f$ is universally closed.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
By Lemmas \ref{lemma-base-change-quasi-compact}
and \ref{lemma-base-change-valuative-criteria}
properties (1) and (2) are preserved under
any base change. By Lemma \ref{lemma-characterize-universally-closed}
we only have to show that $T \times_Y X \to T$ is universally closed,
whenever $T$ is an affine scheme over $S$ mapping into $Y$. Hence it
suffices to prove: If $Y$ is an affine scheme, $f : X \to Y$ is quasi-compact
and satisfies the existence part of the valuative criterion, then
$f : |X| \to |Y|$ is closed. In this situation $X$ is a quasi-compact
algebraic space. By
Properties of Spaces,
Lemma \ref{spaces-properties-lemma-quasi-compact-affine-cover}
there exists an affine scheme $U$ and a surjective etale morphism
$\varphi : U \to X$. Let $T \subset |X|$ closed. The inverse image
$\varphi^{-1}(T) \subset U$ is closed, and hence is the set of points
of an affine closed subscheme $Z \subset U$. Thus, by
Algebra, Lemma \ref{algebra-lemma-image-stable-specialization-closed}
we see that $f(T) = f(\varphi(|Z|)) \subset |Y|$ is closed if it is
closed under specialization.

\medskip\noindent
Let $y' \leadsto y$ be a specialization in $Y$ with $y' \in f(T)$.
Choose a point $x' \in T \subset |X|$ mapping to $y'$ under $f$.
We may represent $x'$ by a morphism $\text{Spec}(K) \to X$
for some field $K$. Thus we have the following diagram
$$
\xymatrix{
\text{Spec}(K) \ar[r]_-{x'} \ar[d] & X \ar[d]^f \\
\text{Spec}(\mathcal{O}_{Y, y}) \ar[r] & Y,
}
$$
see
Schemes, Section \ref{schemes-section-points}
for the existence of the left vertical map.
Choose a valuation ring $A \subset K$ dominating the image of
the ring map $\mathcal{O}_{Y, y} \to K$ (this is possible since
the image is a local ring and not a field as $y' \not = y$, see
Algebra, Lemma \ref{algebra-lemma-dominate}).
By assumption there exists a field extension $K \subset K'$ and a
valuation ring $A' \subset K'$ dominating $A$, and a morphism
$\text{Spec}(A') \to X$ fitting into the commutative diagram.
Since $A'$ dominates $A$, and $A$ dominates $\mathcal{O}_{Y, y}$
we see that the closed point of $\text{Spec}(A')$ maps to
a point $x \in X$ with $f(x) = y$ which is a specialization of $x'$.
Hence $x \in T$ as $T$ is closed, and hence $y \in f(T)$ as desired.
\end{proof}

\noindent
We also want to prove the converse of
Lemma \ref{lemma-quasi-compact-existence-universally-closed}.
Namely, we would like to show, under additional conditions, that
a quasi-compact morphism is universallly closed if and only if
the existence part of the valuative criterion holds.
Example \ref{example-strange-universally-closed} shows that
$[\mathbf{A}^1_k/\mathbf{Z}] \to \text{Spec}(k)$ is universally
closed, but it is easy to see that the existence part of
the valuative criterion fails. Hence some
additional hypothesis is needed.

\begin{proposition}
\label{proposition-characterize-universally-closed}
Let $S$ be a scheme.
Let $f : X \to Y$ be a morphism of algebraic spaces over $S$.
Assume
\begin{enumerate}
\item $f$ is quasi-compact, and
\item $X$ has property $(\gamma)$ of
Properties of Spaces, Lemma \ref{spaces-properties-lemma-bounded-fibres}.
\end{enumerate}
Then $f$ is universally closed if and only if the
existence part of the valuative criterion holds.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
In Lemma \ref{lemma-quasi-compact-existence-universally-closed}
we have seen one of the implications.
To prove the other, assume that $f$ is universally closed. Let
$$
\xymatrix{
\text{Spec}(K) \ar[r] \ar[d] & X \ar[d] \\
\text{Spec}(A) \ar[r] & Y
}
$$
be a diagram as in
Definition \ref{definition-valuative-criterion}.
Let $X_A = \text{Spec}(A) \times_Y X$, so that we have
$$
\xymatrix{
\text{Spec}(K) \ar[r] \ar[rd] & X_A \ar[d] \\
 & \text{Spec}(A)
}
$$
By Lemma \ref{lemma-base-change-quasi-compact} we see that
$X_A \to \text{Spec}(A)$ is quasi-compact. Since $X_A \to X$
is representable, we see that $X_A$ has property $(\gamma)$ also, see
Properties of Spaces,
Lemma \ref{spaces-properties-lemma-representable-properties}.
Moreover, as $f$ is universally closed, we see that $X_A \to \text{Spec}(A)$
is universally closed.
Hence we may and do replace $X$ by $X_A$ and $Y$ by $\text{Spec}(A)$.

\medskip\noindent
Let $x' \in |X|$ be the equivalence class of
$\text{Spec}(K) \to X$. Let $y \in |Y| = |\text{Spec}(A)|$ be
the closed point. Set $y' = f(x')$; it is the generic point of
$\text{Spec}(A)$. Since $f$ is universally closed we see that
$f(\overline{\{x'\}})$ contains $\overline{\{y'\}}$, and hence
contains $y$. Let $x \in \overline{\{x'\}}$ be a point such that
$f(x) = y$. Let $U$ be a scheme, and $\varphi : U \to X$
an etale morphism such that there exists a $u \in U$ with
$\varphi(u) = x$. By
Properties of Spaces, Lemma \ref{spaces-properties-lemma-specialization}
and our assumption that $X$ has property $(\gamma)$
there exists a specialization $u' \leadsto u$ on $U$ with $\varphi(u') = x'$.
This means that there exists a common field extension
$K \subset K' \supset \kappa(u')$ such that
$$
\xymatrix{
\text{Spec}(K') \ar[r] \ar[d] & U \ar[d] \\
\text{Spec}(K) \ar[r] \ar[rd] & X \ar[d] \\
 & \text{Spec}(A)
}
$$
is commutative. This gives the following commutative diagram of rings
$$
\xymatrix{
K' & \mathcal{O}_{U, u} \ar[l] \\
K \ar[u] & \\
 & A \ar[lu] \ar[uu]
}
$$
By
Algebra, Lemma \ref{algebra-lemma-dominate}
we can find a valuation ring $A' \subset K'$ dominating the image of
$\mathcal{O}_{U, u}$ in $K'$. Since by construction $\mathcal{O}_{U, u}$
dominates $A$ we see that $A'$ dominates $A$ also. Hence we obtain a diagram
resembling the second diagram of
Definition \ref{definition-valuative-criterion}
and the proposition is proved.
\end{proof}













\section{Separation axioms}
\label{section-separation-axioms}

\noindent
It makes sense to list some a priori properties of the diagonal of
a morphism of algebraic spaces.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-properties-diagonal}
Let $S$ be a scheme contained in $\textit{Sch}_{fppf}$.
Let $f : X \to Y$ be a morphism of algebraic spaces over $S$.
Let $\Delta_{X/Y} : X \to X \times_Y X$ be the diagonal morphism.
Then
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\Delta_{X/Y}$ is representable,
\item $\Delta_{X/Y}$ is locally of finite type,
\item $\Delta_{X/Y}$ is a monomorphism,
\item $\Delta_{X/Y}$ is separated, and
\item $\Delta_{X/Y}$ is locally quasi-finite.
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
We are going to use the fact that $\Delta_{X/S}$ is
representable (by definition of an algebraic space) and that
it satisfies properties (2) -- (5), see
Spaces, Lemma \ref{spaces-lemma-properties-diagonal}.
Note that we have a factorization
$$
X
\longrightarrow
X \times_Y X
\longrightarrow
X \times_S X
$$
of the diagonal $\Delta_{X/S} : X \to X \times_S X$. Since
$X \times_Y X \to X \times_S X$ is a monomorphism, and since
$\Delta_{X/S}$ is representable, it follows formally that
$\Delta_{X/Y}$ is representable. In particular, the rest of
the statements now make sense, by the discussion in
Section \ref{section-representable}.

\medskip\noindent
Choose a surjective etale morphism $U \to X$, with $U$ a scheme.
Consider the diagram
$$
\xymatrix{
R = U \times_X U \ar[r] \ar[d] &
U \times_Y U \ar[d] \ar[r] &
U \times_S U \ar[d] \\
X \ar[r] & X \times_Y X \ar[r] & X \times_S X
}
$$
Both squares are cartesian, hence so is the outer retangle.
The top row consists of schemes, and the vertical arrows
are surjective etale morphisms. By
Spaces, Lemma \ref{spaces-lemma-representable-morphisms-spaces-property}
the properties (2) -- (5) for $\Delta_{X/Y}$ are equivalent to those of
$R \to U \times_Y U$. In the proof of
Spaces, Lemma \ref{spaces-lemma-properties-diagonal}
we have seen that $R \to U \times_S U$ has properties (2) -- (5).
The morphism $U \times_Y U \to U \times_S U$ is a monomorphism
of schemes. These facts imply that $R \to U \times_S U$ have
properties (2) -- (5).

\medskip\noindent
Namely: For (3), note that $R \to U \times_Y U$
is a monomorphism as the composition
$R \to U \times_S U$ is a monomorphism. For (2), note that
$R \to U \times_Y U$ is locally of finite type, as the
composition $R \to U \times_S U$ is locally of finite type
(Morphisms, Lemma \ref{morphisms-lemma-permanence-finite-type}).
A monomorphism which is locally of finite type is locally quasi-finite
because it has finite fibres
(Morphisms, Lemma \ref{morphisms-lemma-finite-fibre}), hence (5).
A monomorphism is separated
(Schemes, Lemma \ref{schemes-lemma-monomorphism-separated}), hence (4).
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}
\label{definition-separated}
Let $S$ be a scheme.
Let $f : X \to Y$ be a morphism of algebraic spaces over $S$.
Let $\Delta_{X/Y} : X \to X \times_Y X$ be the diagonal morphism.
\begin{enumerate}
\item We say $f$ is {\it separated} if $\Delta_{X/Y}$ is a closed immersion.
\item We say $f$ is {\it weakly locally separated}\footnote{This is probably
nonstandard notation.} if $\Delta_{X/Y}$ is an immersion.
\item We say $f$ is {\it locally separated} if $\Delta_{X/Y}$ is a
quasi-compact immersion.
\item We say $f$ is {\it quasi-separated} if $\Delta_{X/Y}$ is quasi-compact.
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

\noindent
This definition makes sense since $\Delta_{X/Y}$ is representable,
and hence we know what it means for it to have one of the properties
described in the definition. We will see below
(Lemma \ref{lemma-match-separated}) that this definition matches the ones
we already have for morphisms of schemes and representable morphisms.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-trivial-implications}
Let $S$ be a scheme.
Let $f : X \to Y$ be a morphism of algebraic spaces over $S$.
We have the following implications among the separation axioms
of Definition \ref{definition-separated}:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $f$ separated implies all the others, and
\item $f$ locally separated implies $f$ quasi-separated and
$f$ weakly locally separated.
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Omitted.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-base-change-separated}
All of the separation axioms listed in Defintion \ref{definition-separated}
are stable under base change.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Let $f : X \to Y$ and $Y' \to Y$ be morphisms of algebraic spaces.
Let $f' : X' \to Y'$ be the base change of $f$ by $Y' \to Y$. Then
$\Delta_{X'/Y'}$ is the base change of $\Delta_{X/Y}$ by
the morphism $X' \times_{Y'} X' \to X \times_Y X$. By the results of
Section \ref{section-representable}
each of the properties of the diagonal used in
Definition \ref{definition-separated}
is stable under base change. Hence the lemma is true.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-fibre-product-after-map}
Let $S$ be a scheme. Let $f : X \to Z$, $g : Y \to Z$ and $Z \to T$
be morphisms of algebraic spaces over $S$. Consider the induced morphism
$i : X \times_Z Y \to X \times_T Y$. Then
\begin{enumerate}
\item $i$ is representable, locally of finite type, locally quasi-finite,
separated and a monomorphism,
\item if $Z \to T$ is weakly locally separated, then $i$ is an immersion,
\item if $Z \to T$ is locally separated, then $i$ is a quasi-compact immersion,
\item if $Z \to T$ is separated, then $i$ is a closed immersion, and
\item if $Z \to T$ is quasi-separated, then $i$ is quasi-compact.
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
By general category theory the following diagram
$$
\xymatrix{
X \times_Z Y \ar[r]_i \ar[d] & X \times_T Y \ar[d] \\
Z \ar[r]^-{\Delta_{Z/T}} \ar[r] & Z \times_T Z
}
$$
is a fibre product diagram. Hence $i$ is the base change of the
diagonal morphism $\Delta_{Z/T}$. Thus the lemma follows
from Lemma \ref{lemma-properties-diagonal}, and the material in
Section \ref{section-representable}.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-semi-diagonal}
Let $S$ be a scheme. Let $T$ be an algebraic space over $S$.
Let $g : X \to Y$ be a morphism of algebraic spaces over $T$.
Consider the graph $i : X \to X \times_T Y$ of $g$. Then
\begin{enumerate}
\item $i$ is representable, locally of finite type, locally quasi-finite,
separated and a monomorphism,
\item if $Y \to T$ is weakly locally separated, then $i$ is an immersion,
\item if $Y \to T$ is locally separated, then $i$ is a quasi-compact immersion,
\item if $Y \to T$ is separated, then $i$ is a closed immersion, and
\item if $Y \to T$ is quasi-separated, then $i$ is quasi-compact.
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
This is a special case of Lemma \ref{lemma-fibre-product-after-map}
applied to the morphism $X = X \times_Y Y \to X\times_T Y$.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-section-immersion}
Let $S$ be a schemes.
Let $f : X \to T$ be a morphism of algebraic spaces over $S$.
Let $s : T \to X$ be a section of $f$ (in a formula
$f \circ s = \text{id}_T$). Then
\begin{enumerate}
\item $s$ is representable, locally of finite type, locally quasi-finite,
separated and a monomorphism,
\item if $f$ is weakly locally separated, then $i$ is an immersion,
\item if $f$ is locally separated, then $i$ is a quasi-compact immersion,
\item if $f$ is separated, then $i$ is a closed immersion, and
\item if $f$ is quasi-separated, then $i$ is quasi-compact.
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
This is a special case of Lemma \ref{lemma-semi-diagonal} applied to
$g = s$ so the morphism $i = s : T \to T \times_T X$.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-composition-separated}
All of the separation axioms listed in Defintion \ref{definition-separated}
are stable under composition of morphisms.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Let $f : X \to Y$ and $g : Y \to Z$ be morphisms of algebraic spaces
to which the axiom in question applies.
The diagonal $\Delta_{X/Z}$ is the composition
$$
X \longrightarrow X \times_Y X \longrightarrow X \times_Z X.
$$
Our separation axiom is defined by requiring the diagonal
to have some property $\mathcal{P}$. By
Lemma \ref{lemma-fibre-product-after-map} above we see that
the second arrow also has this property. Hence the lemma follows
since the composition of (representable) morphisms with property
$\mathcal{P}$ also is a morphism with property $\mathcal{P}$, see
Section \ref{section-representable}.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-compose-after-separated}
Let $S$ be a scheme.
Let $f : X \to Y$ and $g : Y \to Z$ be morphisms of algebraic spaces over $S$.
\begin{enumerate}
\item If $g \circ f$ is separated then so is $f$.
\item If $g \circ f$ is weakly locally separated then so is $f$.
\item If $g \circ f$ is locally separated then so is $f$.
\item If $g \circ f$ is quasi-separated then so is $f$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Consider the factorization
$$
X \to X \times_Y X \to X \times_Z X
$$
of the diagonal morphism of $g \circ f$. In any case the last morphism
is a monomorphism. Hence for any scheme $T$ and morphism
$T \to X \times_Y X$ we have the equality
$$
X \times_{(X \times_Y X)} T = X \times_{(X \times_Z X)} T.
$$
Hence the result is clear.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-characterize-separated}
Let $S$ be a scheme.
Let $f : X \to Y$ be a morphism of algebraic spaces over $S$.
Let $\mathcal{P}$ be any of the separation
axioms of Definition \ref{definition-separated}.
The following are equivalent
\begin{enumerate}
\item $f$ is $\mathcal{P}$,
\item for every scheme $Z$ and morphism $Z \to Y$ the
base change $Z \times_Y X \to Z$ of $f$ is $\mathcal{P}$,
\item for every affine scheme $Z$ and every morphism $Z \to Y$ the
base change $Z \times_Y X \to Z$ of $f$ is $\mathcal{P}$,
\item for every affine scheme $Z$ and every morphism $Z \to Y$ the
algebraic space $Z \times_Y X$ is $\mathcal{P}$ (see
Properties of Spaces, Definition \ref{spaces-properties-definition-separated}),
and
\item there exists a scheme $V$ and a surjective etale morphism
$V \to Y$ such that the base change $V \times_Y X \to V$ has
$\mathcal{P}$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
We will repeatedly use
Lemma \ref{lemma-base-change-separated}
without further mention. In particular, it is clear that
(1) implies (2) and (2) implies (3).

\medskip\noindent
Let us prove that (3) and (4) are equivalent. Note that if $Z$ is an affine
scheme, then the morphism $Z \to \text{Spec}(\mathbf{Z})$ is a separated
morphism as a morphism of algebraic spaces over $\text{Spec}(\mathbf{Z})$.
If $Z \times_Y X \to Z$ is $\mathcal{P}$, then
$Z \times_Y X \to \text{Spec}(\mathbf{Z})$ is $\mathcal{P}$
as a composition (see
Lemma \ref{lemma-composition-separated}). Hence the algebraic
space $Z \times_Y X$ is $\mathcal{P}$. Conversely, if the algebraic
space $Z \times_Y X$ is $\mathcal{P}$, then
$Z \times_Y X \to \text{Spec}(\mathbf{Z})$ is $\mathcal{P}$, and
hence by
Lemma \ref{lemma-compose-after-separated}
we see that $Z \times_Y X \to Z$ is $\mathcal{P}$.

\medskip\noindent
Let us prove that (3) implies (5). Assume (3). Let $V$ be a scheme
and let $V \to Y$ be etale surjective. We have to show that
$V \times_Y X \to V$ has property $\mathcal{P}$. In other words,
we have to show that the morphism
$$
V \times_Y X \longrightarrow
(V \times_Y X) \times_V (V \times_Y X) = V \times_Y X \times_Y X
$$
has the corresponding property (i.e., is a closed immersion, immersion,
quasi-compact immersion, or quasi-compact). Let $V = \bigcup V_j$ be an
affine open covering of $V$. By assumption we know that each of the morphisms
$$
V_j \times_Y X \longrightarrow V_j \times_Y X \times_Y X
$$
does have the corresponding property. Since being a closed immersion,
immersion, quasi-compact immersion, or quasi-compact is Zariski local
on the target, and since the $V_j$ cover $V$ we get the desired conclusion.

\medskip\noindent
Let us prove that (5) implies (1). Let $V \to Y$ be as in (5).
Then we have the fibre product diagram
$$
\xymatrix{
V \times_Y X \ar[r] \ar[d] &
X \ar[d] \\
V \times_Y X \times_Y X \ar[r] &
X \times_Y X
}
$$
By assumption the left vertical arrow is a closed immersion,
immersion, quasi-compact immersion, or quasi-compact. It follows from
Spaces, Lemma \ref{spaces-lemma-descent-representable-transformations-property}
that also the right vertical arrow is a closed immersion,
immersion, quasi-compact immersion, or quasi-compact.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-match-separated}
Let $S$ be a scheme.
If $f : X \to Y$ is a representable morphism of algebraic spaces over $S$,
then $f$ is (quasi-)separated in the sense of
Definition \ref{definition-separated}
above if and only if $f$ is (quasi-)separated in the sense of
Section \ref{section-representable}. In particular,
if $f : X \to Y$ is a morphism of schemes over $S$, then
$f$ is (quasi-)separated in the sense of
Definition \ref{definition-separated}
if and only if $f$ is (quasi-)separated as a morphism of schemes.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
This is the equivalence of (1) and (2) of
Lemma \ref{lemma-characterize-separated}.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-quasi-compact-permanence}
Let $S$ be a scheme.
Let $f : X \to Y$ and $g : Y \to Z$ be morphisms of algebraic spaces over $S$.
If $g \circ f$ is quasi-compact and $g$ is quasi-separated
then $f$ is quasi-compact.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
This is true because $f$ equals the composition
$(1, f) : X \to X \times_Z Y \to Y$. The first map
is quasi-compact by Lemma \ref{lemma-section-immersion}
because it is a section of the quasi-separated morphism $X \times_Z Y \to X$
(a base change of $g$, see Lemma \ref{lemma-base-change-separated}).
The second map is quasi-compact as it
is the base change of $f$, see
Lemma \ref{lemma-base-change-quasi-compact}.
And compositions of quasi-compact
morphisms are quasi-compact, see Lemma \ref{lemma-composition-quasi-compact}.
\end{proof}






\section{Valuative criterion of separatedness}
\label{section-valuative-separatedness}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-separated-implies-valuative}
Let $S$ be a scheme.
Let $f : X \to Y$ be a morphism of algebraic spaces over $S$.
If $f$ is separated, then $f$ satisfies the uniqueness
part of the valuative criterion.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Let a diagram as in Definition \ref{definition-valuative-criterion}
be given. Suppose there are two distinct morphisms
$a, b : \text{Spec}(A) \to X$ fitting into the diagram.
Let $Z \subset \text{Spec}(A)$ be the equalizer of $a$ and $b$.
Then $Z = \text{Spec}(A) \times_{(a, b), X \times_Y X, \Delta} X$.
If $f$ is separated, then $\Delta$ is a closed immersion, and
this is a closed subscheme of $\text{Spec}(A)$. By assumption it contains
the generic point of $\text{Spec}(A)$. Since $A$ is a domain
this implies $Z = \text{Spec}(A)$. Hence $a = b$ as desired.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-valuative-criterion-separatedness}
(Valuative criterion separatedness.)
Let $S$ be a scheme.
Let $f : X \to Y$ be a morphism of algebraic spaces over $S$.
Assume
\begin{enumerate}
\item the morphism $f$ is quasi-separated, and
\item the morphism $f$ satisfies the uniqueness
part of the valuative criterion.
\end{enumerate}
Then $f$ is separated.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Assumption (1) means $\Delta_{X/Y}$ is quasi-compact.
We claim the morphism
$\Delta_{X/Y} : X \to X \times_Y X$ satisfies the existence
part of the valuative criterion.
Let a solid commutative diagram
$$
\xymatrix{
\text{Spec}(K) \ar[r] \ar[d] & X \ar[d] \\
\text{Spec}(A) \ar[r] \ar@{-->}[ru] & X \times_Y X
}
$$
be given. The lower right arrow corresponds to a
pair of morphisms $a, b : \text{Spec}(A) \to X$ over $Y$.
By assumption (2) we see that $a = b$. Hence using $a$ as the dotted
arrow works. Hence
Lemma \ref{lemma-quasi-compact-existence-universally-closed}
applies, and we see that $\Delta_{X/Y}$ is universally closed.
Since always $\Delta_{X/Y}$ is locally of finite type and
separated, we conclude from
More on Morphisms, Lemma \ref{more-morphisms-lemma-characterize-finite}
that $\Delta_{X/Y}$ is a finite morphism (also, use the
general principle of
Spaces, Lemma
\ref{spaces-lemma-representable-transformations-property-implication}).
At this point $\Delta_{X/Y}$ is a representable, finite monomorphism,
hence a closed immersion by
Morphisms, Lemma \ref{morphisms-lemma-finite-monomorphism-closed}.
\end{proof}








\section{Relative conditions}
\label{section-relative-conditions}

\noindent
This is a (yet another) technical section dealing with conditions on
algebraic spaces having to do with points. It is probably a good idea
to skip this section.

\begin{definition}
\label{definition-relative-conditions}
Let $S$ be a scheme.
\begin{enumerate}
\item We say an algebraic space $X$ over $S$ {\it has
property $(\beta)$, $(\gamma)$, $(\delta)$, or $(\epsilon)$} if $X$
has the corresponding property of
Properties of Spaces, Lemma \ref{spaces-properties-lemma-bounded-fibres}.
\item An algebraic space which has $(\epsilon)$ is called a

\item Let $f : X \to Y$ be a morphism of algebraic spaces over $S$.
We say $f$ {\it has property $(\beta)$, $(\gamma)$, $(\delta)$,
or $(\epsilon)$} if for any scheme $T$ and morphism $T \to Y$
the fibre product $T \times_Y X$ has the corresponding property.
\item A morphism $f$ which has $(\epsilon)$ is called a

We refer to Remark \ref{remark-reasonable} for an informal discussion.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-base-change-relative-conditions}
Having property $(\beta)$, $(\gamma)$,
$(\delta)$, or $(\epsilon)$ is preserved under arbitrary base change.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Omitted.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-composition-relative-conditions}
Having property $(\beta)$, $(\gamma)$, or $(\delta)$
is preserved under compositions.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Let $\omega \in \{\beta, \gamma, \delta\}$.
Let $f : X \to Y$ and $g : Y \to Z$ be morphisms of algebraic spaces
over the scheme $S$. Assume $f$ and $g$ both have property
$(\omega)$. Then we have to show
that for any scheme $T$ and morphism $T \to Z$ the space $T \times_Z X$
has $(\omega)$. By
Lemma \ref{lemma-base-change-relative-conditions}
this reduces us to the following claim: Suppose that $Y$ is an algebraic
space having property $(\omega)$, and that $f : X \to Y$ is a morphism
with $(\omega)$. Then $X$ has $(\omega)$.

\medskip\noindent
Let us prove the claim in case $\omega = \beta$. In this case we have to show
that any $x \in |X|$ is represented by a monomorphism from the spectrum
of a field into $X$. Let $y = f(x) \in |Y|$. By assumption there exists
a field $k$ and a monomorphism $\text{Spec}(k) \to Y$ representing $y$.
Then $x$ corresponds to a point $x'$ of $\text{Spec}(k) \times_Y X$.
By assumption $x'$ is represented by a monomorphism
$\text{Spec}(k') \to \text{Spec}(k) \times_Y X$. Clearly the composition
$\text{Spec}(k') \to X$ is a monomorphism representing $x$.

\medskip\noindent
Let us prove the claim in case $\omega = \gamma$.
Let $x \in |X|$ and $y = f(x) \in |Y|$. By the result of the preceding
paragraph we can choose a diagram
$$
\xymatrix{
\text{Spec}(k') \ar[r]_x \ar[d] & X \ar[d]^f \\
\text{Spec}(k) \ar[r]^y & Y
}
$$
with horizontal arrows monomorphisms. We are going to denote
fibre products of the form $\text{Spec}(k) \times_{y, Y} ?$,
resp.\ $\text{Spec}(k') \times_{x, X} ?$ by $?_y$, resp.\ $?_x$.
Choose an affine scheme $V$ and etale morphism $V \to Y$
such that $V_y$ is not empty. Choose an affine scheme $U$ and an
etale morphism $U \to V \times_Y X$ such that
$U_x$ is not empty. Picture:
$$
\xymatrix{
U \ar[r] \ar[rd] & V \times_Y X \ar[d] \ar[r] & X \ar[d]^f \\
 & V \ar[r] & Y
}
$$
The assumption $(\gamma)$ for $Y$ implies that $V_y$ is a finite scheme
over $k$ and the assumption $(\gamma)$ for $f$ (applied to the base change
of $f$ by $V_y \to Y$) implies the fibres of
$U_x \to \text{Spec}(k') \times_{\text{Spec}(k)} V_y = (V \times_Y X)_x$
are finite. Note that the morphism
$U_x \to \text{Spec}(k') \times_{\text{Spec}(k)} V_y$ is etale.
Hence the scheme $U_x$ is finite. As the point $x$ was arbitrary
Properties of Spaces,
Lemma \ref{spaces-properties-lemma-UR-finite-above-x} part (3)
implies $(\gamma)$ holds for $X$.

\medskip\noindent
Let us prove the claim in case $\omega = \delta$.
Choose $V \to Y$ etale with $V$ an affine scheme.
Choose $U \to V \times_Y X$ etale with $U$ an affine scheme.
By assumption $V \to Y$ has universally bounded fibres. By
Properties of Spaces,
Lemma \ref{spaces-properties-lemma-base-change-universally-bounded}
$V \times_Y X \to X$ has universally bounded fibres.
By assumption on $f$ we see that $U \to V \times_Y X$ has
universally bounded fibres. By
Properties of Spaces,
Lemma \ref{spaces-properties-lemma-composition-universally-bounded}
the composition $U \to X$ has universally bounded fibres.
Hence there exists sufficiently many etale morphisms $U \to X$
from schemes with universally bounded fibres, and we conclude
that $X$ has property $(\delta)$.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-descent-conditions}
Let $S$ be a scheme.
Let $f : X \to Y$ be a morphism of algebraic spaces over $S$.
Let $\mathcal{P} \in \{(\beta), (\gamma), (\delta)\}$.
Assume
\begin{enumerate}
\item $f$ is quasi-compact,
\item $f$ is etale,
\item $f$ is surjective, and
\item the algebraic space $X$ has property $\mathcal{P}$.
\end{enumerate}
Then $Y$ has property $\mathcal{P}$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Let us prove this in case $\mathcal{P} = (\beta)$. Let $y \in |Y|$ be
a point. We have to show that $y$ can be represented by a monomorphism
from a field. Choose a point $x \in |X|$ with $f(x) = y$. This is possible by
Properties of Spaces,
Lemma \ref{spaces-properties-lemma-characterize-surjective}.
By assumption we may represent $x$ by a monomorphism
$\text{Spec}(k) \to X$, with $k$ a field. By
Properties of Spaces,
Lemma \ref{spaces-properties-lemma-R-finite-above-x}
it suffices to show that the projections
$\text{Spec}(k) \times_Y \text{Spec}(k) \to \text{Spec}(k)$
are etale and quasi-compact. We can factor the first projection as
$$
\text{Spec}(k) \times_Y \text{Spec}(k)
\longrightarrow
\text{Spec}(k) \times_Y X
\longrightarrow
\text{Spec}(k)
$$
The first morphism is a monomorphism, and the second is etale and
quasi-compact. By
Properties of Spaces,
Lemma \ref{spaces-properties-lemma-etale-over-field-scheme}
we see that $\text{Spec}(k) \times_Y X$ is a scheme. Hence it is a
finite disjoint union of spectra of finite separable field extensions
of $k$. By
Schemes, Lemma \ref{schemes-lemma-mono-towards-spec-field}
we see that the first arrow identifies
$\text{Spec}(k) \times_Y \text{Spec}(k)$ with a finite disjoint
union of spectra of finite separable field extensions of $k$.
Hence the projection morphism is etale and quasi-compact.

\medskip\noindent
Let us prove this in case $\mathcal{P} = (\gamma)$.
We have already seen in the first paragraph of the proof that this implies
that every $y \in |Y|$ can be represented by a monomorphism
$y : \text{Spec}(k) \to Y$. Pick such a $y$. Pick an affine
scheme $U$ and an etale morphism $U \to X$ such that the image
of $|U| \to |Y|$ contains $y$. By
Properties of Spaces,
Lemma \ref{spaces-properties-lemma-UR-finite-above-x}
it suffices to show that $U_y$ is a finite scheme over $k$. The fibre
product $X_y = \text{Spec}(k) \times_Y X$ is a quasi-compact etale
algebraic space over $k$. Hence by
Properties of Spaces,
Lemma \ref{spaces-properties-lemma-etale-over-field-scheme}
it is a scheme. So it is a finite disjoint union of spectra of
finite separable extensions of $k$. Say $X_y = \{x_1, \ldots, x_n\}$
so $x_i$ is given by  $x_i : \text{Spec}(k_i) \to X$ with
$[k_i : k] < \infty$. By assumption $X$ has $(\gamma)$, so the schemes
$U_{x_i} = \text{Spec}(k_i) \times_X U$ is finite over $k_i$.
Finally, we note that $U_y = \coprod U_{x_i}$ as a scheme and we conclude
that $U_y$ is finite over $k$ as desired.

\medskip\noindent
Let us prove this in case $\mathcal{P} = (\delta)$.
Pick an affine scheme $V$ and an etale morphism $V \to Y$.
We have the show the fibres of $V \to Y$ are universally bounded.
The algebraic space $V \times_Y X$ is quasi-compact.
Thus we can find an affine scheme $W$ and a surjective etale morphism
$W \to V \times_Y X$, see
Properties of Spaces,
Lemma \ref{spaces-properties-lemma-quasi-compact-affine-cover}.
Here is a picture (solid diagram)
$$
\xymatrix{
W \ar[r]  \ar[rd] &
V \times_Y X \ar[r] \ar[d] &
X \ar[d]_f & \text{Spec}(k) \ar@{..>}[l]^x \ar@{..>}[ld]^y \\
 & V \ar[r] & Y
}
$$
The morphism $W \to X$ is universally bounded by our assumption that
the space $X$ has property $(\delta)$. Let $n$ be an integer bounding
the degrees of the fibres of $W \to X$. We claim that the same integer
works for bounding the fibres of $V \to Y$. Namely, suppose $y \in |Y|$
is a point. Then there exists a $x \in |X|$ with $f(x) = y$ (see above).
This means we can find a field $k$ and morphisms $x, y$ given as dotted
arrows in the diagram above. In particular we get a surjective etale
morphism
$$
\text{Spec}(k) \times_{x, X} W
\to
\text{Spec}(k) \times_{x, X} (V \times_Y X) = \text{Spec}(k) \times_{y, Y} V
$$
which shows that the degree of $\text{Spec}(k) \times_{y, Y} V$ over $k$
is less than or equal to the degree of $\text{Spec}(k) \times_{x, X} W$
over $k$, i.e., $\leq n$, and we win. (This last part of the argument
is the same as the argument in the proof of
Properties of Spaces,
Lemma \ref{spaces-properties-lemma-descent-universally-bounded}. Unfortunately
that lemma is not general enough because it only applies to representable
morphisms.)
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-characterize-relative-conditions}
Let $S$ be a scheme.
Let $f : X \to Y$ be a morphism of algebraic spaces over $S$.
Let $\mathcal{P} \in \{(\beta), (\gamma), (\delta), (\epsilon)\}$.
The following are equivalent
\begin{enumerate}
\item $f$ is $\mathcal{P}$,
\item for every affine scheme $Z$ and every morphism $Z \to Y$ the
base change $Z \times_Y X \to Z$ of $f$ is $\mathcal{P}$,
\item for every affine scheme $Z$ and every morphism $Z \to Y$ the
algebraic space $Z \times_Y X$ is $\mathcal{P}$.
\end{enumerate}
If $\mathcal{P} \in \{(\beta), (\gamma), (\delta)\}$, then this is also
equivalent to 
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(4)] there exists a scheme $V$ and a surjective etale morphism
$V \to Y$ such that the base change $V \times_Y X \to V$ has
$\mathcal{P}$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
The implications (1) $\Rightarrow$ (2) and (2) $\Rightarrow$ (3) are trivial.
The implication (3) $\Rightarrow$ (1) can be seen as follows.
Let $Z \to Y$ be a morphism whose source is a scheme over $S$.
Consider the algebraic space $Z \times_Y X$. If we assume (3), then
for any affine open $W \subset Z$, the open subspace
$W \times_Y X$ of $Z \times_Y X$ has property $\mathcal{P}$. Hence by
Properties of Spaces, Lemma \ref{spaces-properties-lemma-properties-local}
the space $Z \times_Y X$ has property $\mathcal{P}$, i.e., (1) holds.

\medskip\noindent
The implication (1) $\Rightarrow$ (4) is trivial. Let $V \to Y$ be
an etale morphism from a scheme as in (4). Let $Z$ be an affine scheme,
and let $Z \to Y$ be a morphism. Consider the diagram
$$
\xymatrix{
Z \times_Y V \ar[r]_q \ar[d]_p & V \ar[d] \\
Z \ar[r] & Y
}
$$
Since $p$ is etale, and hence open, we can choose finitely many affine open
subschemes $W_i \subset Z \times_Y V$ such that $Z = \bigcup p(W_i)$.
Consider the commutative diagram
$$
\xymatrix{
V \times_Y X \ar[d] &
(\coprod W_i) \times_Y X \ar[l] \ar[d] \ar[r] &
Z \times_Y X \ar[d] \\
V &
\coprod W_i \ar[l] \ar[r] &
Z
}
$$
We know $V \times_Y X$ has property $\mathcal{P}$. By 
Properties of Spaces,
Lemma \ref{spaces-properties-lemma-representable-properties}
we see that $(\coprod W_i) \times_Y X$ has property $\mathcal{P}$.
Note that the morphism $(\coprod W_i) \times_Y X \to Z \times_Y X$
is etale and quasi-compact as the base change of $\coprod W_i \to Z$.
Hence by Lemma \ref{lemma-descent-conditions}
we conclude that $Z \times_Y X$ has property $\mathcal{P}$.
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}
\label{remark-reasonable}
Informally the properties of
Definition \ref{definition-relative-conditions}
mean the following:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Condition $(\beta)$ on a space means that points are always represented
by monomorphisms from fields.
\item Condition $(\gamma)$ means $(\beta) + $ locally on the space exist etale
coverings whose fibres are finite.
\item Condition $(\delta)$ means $(\gamma) + $ locally on the space exist etale
coverings whose fibres are universally bounded.
\item Reasonable means there exists a Zariski open covering whose
pieces have coverings $\varphi_i : U_i \to X_i$ which are quasi-compact.
Reasonable implies $(\delta)$.
\item A morphism has one of these properties if (very) loosely speaking the
fibres of the morphism have the corresponding properties.
\end{enumerate}
Condition $(\gamma)$ is useful to prove things about specializations of
points on $|X|$. Condition $(\delta)$ is a bit stronger, and technically
quite easy to work with. Reasonable is a good condition in the sense that
it implies that $X$ has a dense open subspace which is a scheme, and
that $|X|$ is a sober topological space. This is not clear for spaces
which have property $(\delta)$ and probably not true (although see
Properties of Spaces,
Remark \ref{spaces-properties-remark-fun-property-almost-reasonable}
for an interesting additional property of spaces of type $(\delta)$).
On the other hand, we do not know whether the class of reasonable
morphisms is closed under composition, and we do not know whether
reasonable spaces satisfy a descent property as the one in
Lemma \ref{lemma-descent-conditions} (even with $f$ assumed representable).
