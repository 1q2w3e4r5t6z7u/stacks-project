\section{Introduction}
\label{section-introduction}

\noindent
In this chapter we introduce some types of morphisms of algebraic spaces.
A reference is \cite{Kn}.

\medskip\noindent
The goal is to extend the definition of each of the types of morphisms of
schemes defined in the chapters on schemes, and on morphisms of schemes
to the category of algebraic spaces. Each case is slightly different and
it seems best to treat them all separately.





\section{Conventions}
\label{section-conventions}

\noindent
The standing assumption is that all schemes are contained in
a big fppf site $\textit{Sch}_{fppf}$. And all rings $A$ considered
have the property that $\text{Spec}(A)$ is (isomorphic) to an
object of this big site.

\medskip\noindent
Let $S$ be a scheme and let $X$ be an algebraic space over $S$.
In this chapter and the following we will write $X \times_S X$
for the product of $X$ with itself (in the category of algebraic
spaces over $S$), instead of $X \times X$.





\section{Properties of representable morphisms}
\label{section-representable}

\noindent
Let $S$ be a scheme.
Let $f : X \to Y$ be a representable morphism of algebraic spaces. In
Spaces, Section \ref{spaces-section-representable-properties}
we defined what it means for $f$ to
have property $\mathcal{P}$ in case $\mathcal{P}$ is a property
of morphisms of schemes which
\begin{enumerate}
\item is preserved under any base change,
see Schemes, Definition \ref{schemes-definition-preserved-by-base-change},
and
\item is fppf local on the base, see
Descent, Definition \ref{descent-definition-property-morphisms-local}.
\end{enumerate}
Namely, in this case we say $f$ has property $\mathcal{P}$ if and only
if for every scheme $U$ and any morphism $U \to Y$ the morphism of schemes
$X \times_Y U \to U$ has property $\mathcal{P}$.

\medskip\noindent
According to the lists in
Spaces, Section \ref{spaces-section-lists}
this applies to the following properties:
(1)(a) closed immersions,
(1)(b) open immersions,
(1)(c) quasi-compact immersions,
(2) quasi-compact,
(3) universally-closed,
(4) (quasi-)separated,
(5) monomorphism,
(6) surjective,
(7) universally injective,
(8) affine,
(9) quasi-affine,
(10) (locally) of finite type,
(11) (locally) quasi-finite,
(12) (locally) of finite presentation,
(13) locally of finite type of relative dimension $d$,
(14) universally open,
(15) flat,
(16) syntomic,
(17) smooth,
(18) unramified,
(19) etale,
(20) proper,
(21) finite or integral,
(22) finite locally free, and
(23) immersion.

\medskip\noindent
In this chapter we will redefine these notions for not necessarily
representable morphisms of algebraic spaces. Whenever we do this we will make
sure that the new definition agrees with the old one, in order to avoid
ambiguity.

\medskip\noindent
Note that the definition above applies whenever $X$ is a scheme,
since a morphism from a scheme to an algebraic space is representable.
And in particular it applies when both $X$ and $Y$ are schemes.
In Spaces, Lemma
\ref{spaces-lemma-morphism-schemes-gives-representable-transformation-property}
we have seen that in this case the definitions
match, and no ambiguity arise.

\medskip\noindent
Furthermore, in Spaces,
Lemma \ref{spaces-lemma-base-change-representable-transformations-property}
we have seen that the property of
representable morphisms of algebraic spaces so defined is stable under
arbitrary base change by a morphism of algebraic spaces.
And finally, in Spaces, Lemmas
\ref{spaces-lemma-composition-representable-transformations-property}
and
\ref{spaces-lemma-product-representable-transformations-property}
we have seen that if $\mathcal{P}$ is stable under compositions,
which holds for the properties
(1)(a), (1)(b), (1)(c), (2) -- (23), except (13) above, then
taking products of representable morphisms preserves property $\mathcal{P}$ 
and compositions of representable morphisms preserves property $\mathcal{P}$.

\medskip\noindent
We will use these facts below, and whenever we do we will simply refer
to this section as a reference.





\section{Immersions}
\label{section-immersions}

\noindent
Open, closed and locally closed immersions of algebraic spaces were defined in
Spaces, Section \ref{spaces-section-Zariski}.
Namely, a morphism of algebraic spaces is a
{\it closed immersion} (resp. {\it open immersion}, resp.\ {\it immersion})
if it is representable and a closed immersion (resp.\ open immersion,
resp.\ immersion) in the sense of Section \ref{section-representable}.

\medskip\noindent
In particular these types of morphisms are stable under base change,
composition and products of morphisms in the category of algebraic
spaces over $S$, see
Spaces, Lemmas \ref{spaces-lemma-composition-immersions} and
\ref{spaces-lemma-base-change-immersions}.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-closed-immersion-local}
Let $S$ be a scheme. Let $f : X \to Y$ be a morphism of algebraic spaces
over $S$. The following are equivalent:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $f$ is a closed immersion (resp.\ open immersion, resp.\ immersion),
\item for every scheme $Z$ and any morphism $Z \to Y$ the morphism
$Z \times_Y X \to Z$ is a closed immersion (resp.\ open immersion,
resp.\ immersion),
\item for every affine scheme $Z$ and any morphism
$Z \to Y$ the morphism $Z \times_Y X \to Z$ is a closed immersion
(resp.\ open immersion, resp.\ immersion),
\item there exists a scheme $V$ and a surjective etale morphism
$V \to Y$ such that $V \times_Y X \to V$ is a closed immersion
(resp.\ open immersion, resp.\ immersion), and
\item there exists a Zariski covering $Y = \bigcup Y_i$ such that
each of the morphisms $f^{-1}(Y_i) \to Y_i$ is a closed immersion
(resp.\ open immersion, resp.\ immersion).
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Using that a base change of a
closed immersion (resp.\ open immersion, resp.\ immersion)
is another one it is clear that (1) implies (2) and (2) implies (3).
Also (3) implies (4) since we can take $V$ to be a disjoint union of
affines, see
Properties of Spaces,
Lemma \ref{spaces-properties-lemma-cover-by-union-affines}.

\medskip\noindent
Assume $V \to Y$ is as in (4).
Let $\mathcal{P}$ be the property
closed immersion (resp.\ open immersion, resp.\ immersion)
of morphisms of schemes. Note that property $\mathcal{P}$
is preserved under any base change and fppf local on the
base (see Section \ref{section-representable}).
Moreover, morphisms of type $\mathcal{P}$ are separated and
locally quasi-finite (in each of the three cases, see
Schemes, Lemma \ref{schemes-lemma-immersions-monomorphisms}, and
Morphisms, Lemma \ref{morphisms-lemma-immersion-locally-quasi-finite}).
Hence by
More on Morphisms, Lemma
\ref{more-morphisms-lemma-separated-locally-quasi-finite-morphisms-fppf-descend}
the morphisms of type $\mathcal{P}$ satisfy descent for fppf covering. Thus
Spaces, Lemma \ref{spaces-lemma-morphism-sheaves-with-P-effective-descent-etale}
applies and we see that $X \to Y$ is representable and has property
$\mathcal{P}$, in other words (1) holds.

\medskip\noindent
The equivalence of (1) and (5) follows from the fact that
$\mathcal{P}$ is Zariski local on the target (since we saw
above that $\mathcal{P}$ is in fact fppf local on the target).
\end{proof}



\section{Quasi-compact morphisms}
\label{section-quasi-compact}

\noindent
By Section \ref{section-representable} we know what it means for
a representable morphism of algebraic spaces to be quasi-compact.
In order to formulate the definition for a general morphism
of algebraic spaces we make the following observation.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-characterize-representable-quasi-compact}
Let $S$ be a scheme.
Let $f : X \to Y$ be a representable morphism of algebraic spaces over $S$.
The following are equivalent:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $f$ is quasi-compact, and
\item for every quasi-compact algebraic space $Z$ and any morphism
$Z \to Y$ the algebraic space $Z \times_Y X$ is quasi-compact.
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Assume (1), and let $Z \to Y$ be a morphism of algebraic spaces with
$Z$ quasi-compact. By
Properties of Spaces,
Definition \ref{spaces-properties-definition-quasi-compact}
there exists a quasi-compact scheme $U$ and a surjective etale
morphism $U \to Z$. Since $f$ is representable and quasi-compact
we see by definition that $U \times_Y X$ is a scheme, and that
$U \times_Y X \to U$ is quasi-compact. Hence $U \times_Y X$ is
a quasi-compact scheme. The morphism $U \times_Y X \to Z \times_Y X$
is etale and surjective (as the base change of the representable
etale and surjective morphism $U \to Z$, see
Section \ref{section-representable}).
Hence by definition $Z \times_Y X$ is quasi-compact.

\medskip\noindent
Assume (2). Let $Z \to Y$ be a morphism, where $Z$ is a scheme.
We have to show that $p : Z \times_Y X \to Z$ is quasi-compact.
Let $U \subset Z$ be affine open. Then $p^{-1}(U) = U \times_Y Z$
and the scheme $U \times_Y Z$ is quasi-compact by assumption (2).
Hence $p$ is quasi-compact, see
Schemes, Section \ref{schemes-section-quasi-compact}.
\end{proof}

\noindent
This motivates the following definition.

\begin{definition}
\label{definition-quasi-compact}
Let $S$ be a scheme.
Let $f : X \to Y$ be a morphism of algebraic spaces over $S$.
We say $f$ is {\it quasi-compact} if for every quasi-compact
algebraic space $Z$ and morphism $Z \to Y$ the fibre product
$Z \times_Y X$ is quasi-compact.
\end{definition}

\noindent
By Lemma \ref{lemma-characterize-representable-quasi-compact}
above this agrees with the already existing notion
for representable morphisms of algebraic spaces.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-base-change-quasi-compact}
The base change of a quasi-compact morphism of algebraic spaces
by any morphism of algebraic spaces is quasi-compact.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Omitted.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-composition-quasi-compact}
The composition of a pair of quasi-compact morphisms of algebraic spaces
is quasi-compact.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Omitted.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-quasi-compact-local}
Let $S$ be a scheme.
Let $f : X \to Y$ be a morphism of algebraic spaces over $S$.
The following are equivalent:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $f$ is quasi-compact,
\item for every scheme $Z$ and any morphism $Z \to Y$ the morphism of
algebraic spaces $Z \times_Y X \to Z$ is quasi-compact,
\item for every affine scheme $Z$ and any morphism
$Z \to Y$ the algebraic space $Z \times_Y X$ is quasi-compact,
\item there exists a scheme $V$ and a surjective etale morphism
$V \to Y$ such that $V \times_Y X \to V$ is a quasi-compact morphism
of algebraic spaces, and
\item there exists a Zariski covering $Y = \bigcup Y_i$ such that
each of the morphisms $f^{-1}(Y_i) \to Y_i$ is quasi-compact.
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
We will use Lemma \ref{lemma-base-change-quasi-compact}
without further mention.
It is clear that (1) implies (2) and that (2) implies (3).
Assume (3). Let $Z$ be a quasi-compact algebraic space over $S$,
and let $Z \to Y$ be a morphism. By
Properties of Spaces, Lemma
\ref{spaces-properties-lemma-quasi-compact-affine-cover}
there exists an affine scheme $U$ and a surjective etale morphism
$U \to Z$. Then $U \times_Y X \to Z \times_Y X$ is surjective and
etale. Hence by
Properties of Spaces, Lemma
\ref{spaces-properties-lemma-characterize-surjective}
the map $|U \times_Y X| \to |Z \times_Y X|$ is surjective.
By assumption $|U \times_Y X|$ is quasi-compact, so
we conclude that $|Z \times_Y X|$ is quasi-compact.
This proves that (3) implies (1).

\medskip\noindent
That (1) implies (4) is clear. Let $V \to Y$ be as in
condition (4). Let $Z$ be an
affine scheme, and let $Z \to Y$ be a morphism. Consider the diagram
$$
\xymatrix{
Z \times_Y V \ar[r] \ar[d] & V \ar[d] \\
Z \ar[r] & Y
}
$$
As the left vertical arrow is etale, hence open,
we can find a quasi-compact open $W \subset V \times_Y Z$ which
surjects onto $Z$. By assumption the space $W \times_V (V \times_Y X)$
is quasi-compact. Since $W \times_V (V \times_Y X) \to Z \times_Y X$
is surjective we conclude that $|Z \times_Y X|$ is quasi-compact as
before. Hence (3) holds.

\medskip\noindent
Of course (1) implies (5) by taking the covering $Y = Y$.
Assume $Y = \bigcup Y_i$ is as in (5). Let $Z$ be affine and let
$Z \to Y$ be a morphism. Then there exists a finite standard affine
covering $Z = Z_1 \cup \ldots \cup Z_n$ such that each $Z_j \to Y$
factors through $Y_{i_j}$ for some $i_j$. Hence the algebraic space
$$
Z_j \times_Y X = Z_j \times_{Y_{i_j}} f^{-1}(Y_{i_j})
$$
is quasi-compact. Since
$Z \times_Y X = \bigcup_{j = 1, \ldots, n} Z_j \times_Y X$
is a Zariski covering we see that
$|Z \times_Y X| = \bigcup_{j = 1, \ldots, n} |Z_j \times_Y X|$
(see Properties of Spaces, Lemma \ref{spaces-properties-lemma-open-subspaces})
is a finite union of quasi-compact spaces, hence quasi-compact.
Thus we see that (5) implies (3).
\end{proof}




\section{Universally closed morphisms}
\label{section-universally-closed}

\noindent
For a representable morphism of algebraic spaces we have already defined (in
Section \ref{section-representable})
what it means to be universally closed. Hence before we give the natural
definition we check that it agrees with this in the representable case.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-characterize-representable-universally-closed}
Let $S$ be a scheme. Let $f : X \to Y$ be a representable morphism of
algebraic spaces over $S$. The following are equivalent
\begin{enumerate}
\item $f$ is universally closed, and
\item for every morphism of algebraic spaces $Z \to Y$ the morphism of
topological spaces $|Z \times_Y X| \to |Z|$ is closed.
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Assume (1), and let $Z \to Y$ be as in (2). Choose a scheme $V$ and
a surjective etale morphism $V \to Y$. By assumption the morphism
of schemes $V \times_Y X \to V$ is universally closed. By
Properties of Spaces, Section \ref{spaces-properties-section-points}
in the commutative diagram
$$
\xymatrix{
|V \times_Y X| \ar[r] \ar[d] & |Z \times_Y X| \ar[d] \\
|V| \ar[r] & |Z|
}
$$
the horizontal arrows are open and surjective, and moreover
$$
|V \times_Y X| \longrightarrow |V| \times_{|Z|} |Z \times_Y X|
$$
is surjective. Hence as the left
vertical arrow is closed it follows that the right vertical arrow is
closed. This proves (2). The implication (2) $\Rightarrow$ (1) is
immediate from the definitions.
\end{proof}

\noindent
Thus we may use the following natural definition.

\begin{definition}
\label{definition-closed}
Let $S$ be a scheme. Let $f : X \to Y$ be a morphism of algebraic spaces
over $S$.
\begin{enumerate}
\item We say $f$ is {\it closed} if the map of topological
spaces $|X| \to |Y|$ is closed.
\item We say $f$ is {\it universally closed} if for every morphism
of algebraic spaces $Z \to Y$ the morphism of topological spaces
$$
|Z \times_Y X| \to |Z|
$$
is closed, i.e., the base change $Z \times_Y X \to Z$ is closed.
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-base-change-universally-closed}
The base change of a universally closed morphism of algebraic spaces
by any morphism of algebraic spaces is universally closed.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
This is immediate from the definition.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-composition-universally-closed}
The composition of a pair of (universally) closed morphisms of algebraic spaces
is (universally) closed.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Omitted.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-universally-closed-local}
Let $S$ be a scheme. Let $f : X \to Y$ be a morphism of algebraic spaces
over $S$. The following are equivalent
\begin{enumerate}
\item $f$ is universally closed,
\item for every scheme $Z$ and every morphism $Z \to Y$
the projection $|Z \times_Y X| \to |Z|$ is closed,
\item for every affine scheme $Z$ and every morphism $Z \to Y$
the projection $|Z \times_Y X| \to |Z|$ is closed,
\item there exists a scheme $V$ and a surjective etale morphism
$V \to Y$ such that $V \times_Y X \to V$ is a universally closed morpism
of algebraic spaces, and
\item there exists a Zariski covering $Y = \bigcup Y_i$ such that
each of the morphisms $f^{-1}(Y_i) \to Y_i$ is universally closed.
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
We omit the proof that (1) implies (2), and that (2) implies (3).

\medskip\noindent
Assume (3). Choose a surjective etale morphism $V \to Y$.
We are going to show that $V \times_Y X \to V$ is a universally
closed morpism of algebraic spaces. Let $Z \to V$ be a morphism
from an algebraic space to $V$. Let $W \to Z$ be a surjective etale
morphism where $W = \coprod W_i$ is a disjoint union of affine schemes, see
Properties of Spaces,
Lemma \ref{spaces-properties-lemma-cover-by-union-affines}.
Then we have the following commutative diagram
$$
\xymatrix{
\coprod_i |W_i \times_Y X| \ar@{=}[r] \ar[d] &
|W \times_Y X| \ar[r] \ar[d] &
|Z \times_Y X| \ar[d] \ar@{=}[r] &
|Z \times_V (V \times_Y X)| \ar[ld] \\
\coprod |W_i| \ar@{=}[r] &
|W| \ar[r] &
|Z|
}
$$
We have to show the south-east arrow is closed. The middle horizontal
arrows are surjective and open
(Properties of Spaces, Lemma \ref{spaces-properties-lemma-etale-open}).
By assumption (3), and the fact that
$W_i$ is affine we see that the left vertical arrows are closed. Hence
it follows that the right vertical arrow is closed.

\medskip\noindent
Assume (4). We will show that $f$ is universally closed.
Let $Z \to Y$ be a morphism of algebraic spaces. Consider the
diagram
$$
\xymatrix{
|(V \times_Y Z) \times_V (V \times_Y X)| \ar@{=}[r] \ar[rd] &
|V \times_Y X| \ar[r] \ar[d] &
|Z \times_Y X| \ar[d] \\
 &
|V \times_Y Z| \ar[r] &
|Z|
}
$$
The south-west arrow is closed by assumption. The horizontal arrows are
surjective and open because the corresponding morphisms of
algebraic spaces are etale (see
Properties of spaces, Lemma \ref{spaces-properties-lemma-etale-open}).
It follows that the right vertical arrow is closed.

\medskip\noindent
Of course (1) implies (5) by taking the covering $Y = Y$.
Assume $Y = \bigcup Y_i$ is as in (5). Then for any $Z \to Y$
we get a corresponding Zariski covering $Z = \bigcup Z_i$ such that
the base change of $f$ to $Z_i$ is closed. By a simple topological
argument this implies that $Z \times_Y X \to Z$ is closed. Hence (1) holds.
\end{proof}

\begin{example}
\label{example-strange-universally-closed}
Strange example of a universally closed morphism.
Let $\mathbf{Q} \subset k$ be a field of characteristic zero.
Let $X = [\mathbf{A}^1_k/\mathbf{Z}]$ as in
Spaces, Example \ref{spaces-example-affine-line-translation}.
We claim the structure morphism $p : X \to \text{Spec}(k)$
is universally closed.
Namely, if $Z/k$ is a scheme, and $T \subset |X \times_k Z|$ is closed,
then $T$ corresponds to a $\mathbf{Z}$-invariant closed subset of
$T' \subset |\mathbf{A}^1 \times Z|$. It is easy to see that
this implies that $T'$ is the inverse image of a subset $T''$ of
$Z$. By
Morphisms, Lemma \ref{morphisms-lemma-fpqc-quotient-topology}
we have that $T'' \subset Z$ is closed.
Of course $T''$ is the image of $T$. Hence $p$ is universally
closed by Lemma \ref{lemma-universally-closed-local}.
\end{example}




\section{Valuative criteria}
\label{section-valuative}

\noindent
The formulation of the existence part of the valuative criterion is
slightly different for morphisms of algebraic spaces, since it may be
necessary to extend the fraction field of the valuation ring.
See Example, \ref{example-finite-separable-needed}. Here is the definition.

\begin{definition}
\label{definition-valuative-criterion}
Let $S$ be a scheme.
Let $f : X \to Y$ be a morphism of algebraic spaces over $S$.
We say $f$ {\it satisfies the uniqueness part of the valuative criterion}
if given any commutative solid diagram
$$
\xymatrix{
\text{Spec}(K) \ar[r] \ar[d] & X \ar[d] \\
\text{Spec}(A) \ar[r] \ar@{-->}[ru] & Y
}
$$
where $A$ is a valuation ring with field of fractions $K$, there exists
at most one dotted arrow (without requiring existence).
We say $f$ {\it satisfies the existence part of the valuative criterion}
if given any solid diagram as above there exists an extension
$K \subset K'$ of fields, a valuation ring $A' \subset K'$ dominating
$A$ and a morphism $\text{Spec}(A') \to X$ such that the following
diagram commutes
$$
\xymatrix{
\text{Spec}(K') \ar[r] \ar[d] & \text{Spec}(K) \ar[r] & X \ar[d] \\
\text{Spec}(A') \ar[r] \ar[rru] &\text{Spec}(A) \ar[r] & Y
}
$$
We say $f$ {\it satisfies the valuative criterion}
if $f$ satisfies both the existence and uniqueness part.
\end{definition}

\noindent
It turns out that for algebraic spaces, it always sufffices to
take a finite separable extension $K \subset K'$ above.
See Lemma \ref{lemma-finite-separable-enough}.
Before we prove it we show that the criterion
is identical to the criterion as formulated for morphisms of schemes
in case the morphism of algebraic spaces is representable.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-valuative-criterion-representable}
Let $S$ be a scheme.
Let $f : X \to Y$ be a morphism of algebraic spaces over $S$.
Assume $f$ is representable. The following are equivalent
\begin{enumerate}
\item $f$ satisfies the existence part of the valuation criterion
as in Definition \ref{definition-valuative-criterion} above, and
\item given any commutative solid diagram
$$
\xymatrix{
\text{Spec}(K) \ar[r] \ar[d] & X \ar[d] \\
\text{Spec}(A) \ar[r] \ar@{-->}[ru] & Y
}
$$
where $A$ is a valuation ring with field of fractions $K$, there exists
a dotted arrow, i.e., $f$ satisfies the existence part of the valuative
criterion as in
Schemes, Definition \ref{schemes-definition-valuative-criterion}.
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
It suffices to show that given a commutative diagram of the form
$$
\xymatrix{
\text{Spec}(K') \ar[r] \ar[d] & \text{Spec}(K) \ar[r] & X \ar[d] \\
\text{Spec}(A') \ar[r] \ar[rru]^\varphi &\text{Spec}(A) \ar[r] & Y
}
$$
as in Definition \ref{definition-valuative-criterion}, then we can
find a morphism $\text{Spec}(A) \to X$ fitting into the diagram too.
Set $X_A = \text{Spec}(A) \times_Y Y$. As $f$ is representable we see
that $X_A$ is a scheme. The morphism $\varphi$ gives a morphism
$\varphi' : \text{Spec}(A') \to X_A$. Let $x \in X_A$ be the image of
the closed point of $\varphi' : \text{Spec}(A') \to X_A$. Then we
have the following commutative diagram of rings
$$
\xymatrix{
K' & K \ar[l] & \mathcal{O}_{X_A, x} \ar[l] \ar[lld] \\
A' \ar[u] & A \ar[l] & A \ar[l] \ar[u]
}
$$
Since $A$ is a valuation ring, and since $A'$ dominates $A$, we see
that $K \cap A' = A$. Hence the ring map $\mathcal{O}_{X_A, x} \to K$
has image contained in $A$. Whence a morphism $\text{Spec}(A) \to X_A$ (see
Schemes, Section \ref{schemes-section-points})
as desired.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-finite-separable-enough}
Let $S$ be a scheme.
Let $f : X \to Y$ be a morphism of algebraic spaces over $S$.
The following are equivalent
\begin{enumerate}
\item $f$ satisfies the existence part of the valuation criterion
as in Definition \ref{definition-valuative-criterion}, and
\item $f$ satisfies the existence part of the valuation criterion
as in Definition \ref{definition-valuative-criterion} modified by
requiring the extension $K \subset K'$ to be finite separable.
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
We have to show that (1) implies (2). Suppose given a diagram
$$
\xymatrix{
\text{Spec}(K') \ar[r] \ar[d] & \text{Spec}(K) \ar[r] & X \ar[d] \\
\text{Spec}(A') \ar[r] \ar[rru] &\text{Spec}(A) \ar[r] & Y
}
$$
as in Definition \ref{definition-valuative-criterion} with $K \subset K'$
arbitrary. Choose a scheme $U$ and a surjective etale morphism $U \to X$.
Then
$$
\text{Spec}(A') \times_X U \longrightarrow \text{Spec}(A')
$$
is surjective etale. Let $p$ be a point of $\text{Spec}(A') \times_X U$
mapping to the closed point of $\text{Spec}(A')$. Let $p' \leadsto p$
be a generalization of $p$ mapping to the generic point of $\text{Spec}(A')$.
Such a generalization exists because generalizations lift along flat
morphisms of schemes, see
Morphisms, Lemma \ref{morphisms-lemma-generalizations-lift-flat}.
Then $p'$ corresponds to a point of the scheme $\text{Spec}(K') \times_X U$.
Note that
$$
\text{Spec}(K') \times_X U
=
\text{Spec}(K') \times_{\text{Spec}(K)} (\text{Spec}(K) \times_X U)
$$
Hence $p'$ maps to a point $q' \in \text{Spec}(K) \times_X U$ whose
residue field is a finite separable extension of $K$. Finally,
$p' \leadsto p$ maps to a specialization $u' \leadsto u$ on the
scheme $U$. With all this notation we get the following diagram of
rings
$$
\xymatrix{
\kappa(p') & & \kappa(q') \ar[ll] & \kappa(u') \ar[l] \\
& \mathcal{O}_{\text{Spec}(A') \times_X U, p} \ar[lu] & &
\mathcal{O}_{U, u} \ar[ll] \ar[u] \\
K' \ar[uu] & A' \ar[l] \ar[u] & A \ar[l] \ar'[u][uu]
}
$$
This means that the ring $B \subset \kappa(q')$ generated by
the images of $A$ and $\mathcal{O}_{U, u}$ maps to a subring
of $\kappa(p')$ contained in the image $B'$ of
$\mathcal{O}_{\text{Spec}(A') \times_X U, p} \to \kappa(p')$.
Note that $B'$ is a local ring. Let $\mathfrak m \subset B$
be the maximal ideal. By construction $A \cap \mathfrak m$,
(resp.\ $\mathcal{O}_{U, u} \cap \mathfrak m$, resp.\ $A' \cap \mathfrak m$)
is the maximal ideal of $A$ (resp.\ $\mathcal{O}_{U, u}$, resp.\ $A'$).
Set $\mathfrak q = B \cap \mathfrak m$. This is a
prime ideal such that $A \cap \mathfrak q$ is the maximal ideal of $A$.
Hence $B_{\mathfrak q} \subset \kappa(q')$ is a local ring dominating
$A$. By
Algebra, Lemma \ref{algebra-lemma-dominate}
we can find a valuation ring $A_1 \subset \kappa(q')$
with field of fractions $\kappa(q')$
dominating $B_{\mathfrak q}$. The (local) ring map
$\mathcal{O}_{U, u} \to A_1$ gives a morphism
$\text{Spec}(A_1) \to U \to X$
such that the diagram
$$
\xymatrix{
\text{Spec}(\kappa(q')) \ar[r] \ar[d] & \text{Spec}(K) \ar[r] & X \ar[d] \\
\text{Spec}(A_1) \ar[r] \ar[rru] &\text{Spec}(A) \ar[r] & Y
}
$$
is commutative. Since $f.f.(A_1) = \kappa(q') \supset K$ is finite
separable by construction the lemma is proved.
\end{proof}

\begin{example}
\label{example-finite-separable-needed}
Consider the algebraic space $X$ constructed in
Spaces, Example \ref{spaces-example-non-representable-descent}.
Recall that it is the affine line with zero doubled in a Galois twisted
relative to a degree two Galois extension $k \subset k'$.
As such it comes with a morphism
$$
\pi : X \longrightarrow S = \mathbf{A}^1_k
$$
which is quasi-compact. We claim that $\pi$ is universally closed.
Namely, after base change by $\text{Spec}(k') \to \text{Spec}(k)$
the morphism $\pi$ is identified with the morphism
$$
\text{affine line with zero doubled}
\longrightarrow
\text{affine line}
$$
which is universally closed (some details omitted). Since the morphism
$\text{Spec}(k') \to \text{Spec}(k)$ is universally closed and
surjective, a diagram chase shows that $\pi$ is universally closed.
On the other hand, consider the diagram
$$
\xymatrix{
\text{Spec}(k((x))) \ar[r] \ar[d] & X \ar[d]^\pi \\
\text{Spec}(k[[x]]) \ar[r] \ar@{..>}[ru] & \mathbf{A}^1_k
}
$$
Since the unique point of $X$ above $0 \in \mathbf{A}^1_k$
corresponds to a monomorphism $\text{Spec}(k') \to X$
it is clear there cannot exist a dotted arrow! This shows that
a finite separable field extension is needed in general.
\end{example}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-base-change-valuative-criteria}
The base change of a morphism of algebraic spaces which satisfies the
existence part of (resp.\ uniqueness part of) the valuative criterion
by any morphism of algebraic spaces satisfies the
existence part of (resp.\ uniqueness part of) the valuative criterion.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Let $f : X \to Y$ be a morphism of algebraic spaces over the scheme $S$.
Let $Z \to Y$ be any morphism of algebraic spaces over $S$.
Consider a solid commutative diagram of the following shape
$$
\xymatrix{
\text{Spec}(K) \ar[r] \ar[d] & Z \times_Y X \ar[r] \ar[d] & X \ar[d] \\
\text{Spec}(A) \ar[r] \ar@{-->}[ru] \ar@{-->}[rru] & Z \ar[r] & Y
}
$$
Then the set of north-west dotted arrows making the diagram commute
is in 1-1 correspondence with the set of west-north-west dotted arrows
making the diagram commute. This proves the lemma in the case of
``uniqueness''. For the existence part, assume $f$ satisfies the existence
part of the valuative criterion. If we are given a solid commutative
diagram as above, then by assumption there exists an extension $K \subset K'$
of fields and a valuation ring $A' \subset K'$ dominating $A$ and
a morphism $\text{Spec}(A') \to X$ fitting into the following commutative
diagram
$$
\xymatrix{
\text{Spec}(K') \ar[r] \ar[d] &
\text{Spec}(K) \ar[r] & Z \times_Y X \ar[r] & X \ar[d] \\
\text{Spec}(A') \ar[r] \ar[rrru] & \text{Spec}(A) \ar[r] & Z \ar[r] & Y
}
$$
And by the remarks above the skew arrow corresponds to an arrow
$\text{Spec}(A') \to Z \times_Y X$ as desired.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-composition-valuative-criteria}
The composition of two morphisms of algebraic spaces which satisfy the
(existence part of, resp.\ uniqueness part of) the valuative criterion
satisfies the (existence part of, resp.\ uniqueness part of) the valuative
criterion.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Let $f : X \to Y$, $g : Y \to Z$ be morphisms of algebraic spaces over the
scheme $S$. Consider a solid commutative diagram of the following shape
$$
\xymatrix{
\text{Spec}(K) \ar[dd] \ar[r] & X \ar[d]^f \\
& Y \ar[d]^g \\
\text{Spec}(A) \ar[r] \ar@{-->}[ru] \ar@{-->}[ruu] & Z
}
$$
If we have the uniqueness part for $g$, then there exists at
most one north-west dotted arrow making the diagram commute.
If we also have the uniqueness part for $f$, then we have
at most one north-north-west dotted arrow making the diagram
commute. The proof in the existence case comes from contemplating
the following diagram
$$
\xymatrix{
\text{Spec}(K'') \ar[r] \ar[dd] &
\text{Spec}(K') \ar[r] &
\text{Spec}(K) \ar[r] &
X \ar[d]^f \\
& & & Y \ar[d]^g \\
\text{Spec}(A'') \ar[r] \ar[rrruu] &
\text{Spec}(A') \ar[r] \ar[rru] &
\text{Spec}(A) \ar[r] &
Z
}
$$
Namely, the existence part for $g$ gives us the extension $K'$, the
valuation ring $A'$ and the arrow $\text{Spec}(A') \to Y$, whereupon
the existence part for $f$ gives us the extension $K''$, the
valuation ring $A''$ and the arrow $\text{Spec}(A'') \to X$.
\end{proof}






\section{Valuative criterion for universal closedness}
\label{section-valuative-criterion-universally-closed}

\noindent
This is a little more involved than in the case of schemes, especially
since the most optimistic guess is wrong. See discussion below.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-quasi-compact-existence-universally-closed}
Let $S$ be a scheme.
Let $f : X \to Y$ be a morphism of algebraic spaces over $S$.
Assume
\begin{enumerate}
\item $f$ is quasi-compact, and
\item $f$ satisfies the existence part of the valuative criterion.
\end{enumerate}
Then $f$ is universally closed.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
By Lemmas \ref{lemma-base-change-quasi-compact}
and \ref{lemma-base-change-valuative-criteria}
properties (1) and (2) are preserved under
any base change. By Lemma \ref{lemma-universally-closed-local}
we only have to show that $T \times_Y X \to T$ is universally closed,
whenever $T$ is an affine scheme over $S$ mapping into $Y$. Hence it
suffices to prove: If $Y$ is an affine scheme, $f : X \to Y$ is quasi-compact
and satisfies the existence part of the valuative criterion, then
$f : |X| \to |Y|$ is closed. In this situation $X$ is a quasi-compact
algebraic space. By
Properties of Spaces,
Lemma \ref{spaces-properties-lemma-quasi-compact-affine-cover}
there exists an affine scheme $U$ and a surjective etale morphism
$\varphi : U \to X$. Let $T \subset |X|$ closed. The inverse image
$\varphi^{-1}(T) \subset U$ is closed, and hence is the set of points
of an affine closed subscheme $Z \subset U$. Thus, by
Algebra, Lemma \ref{algebra-lemma-image-stable-specialization-closed}
we see that $f(T) = f(\varphi(|Z|)) \subset |Y|$ is closed if it is
closed under specialization.

\medskip\noindent
Let $y' \leadsto y$ be a specialization in $Y$ with $y' \in f(T)$.
Choose a point $x' \in T \subset |X|$ mapping to $y'$ under $f$.
We may represent $x'$ by a morphism $\text{Spec}(K) \to X$
for some field $K$. Thus we have the following diagram
$$
\xymatrix{
\text{Spec}(K) \ar[r]_-{x'} \ar[d] & X \ar[d]^f \\
\text{Spec}(\mathcal{O}_{Y, y}) \ar[r] & Y,
}
$$
see
Schemes, Section \ref{schemes-section-points}
for the existence of the left vertical map.
Choose a valuation ring $A \subset K$ dominating the image of
the ring map $\mathcal{O}_{Y, y} \to K$ (this is possible since
the image is a local ring and not a field as $y' \not = y$, see
Algebra, Lemma \ref{algebra-lemma-dominate}).
By assumption there exists a field extension $K \subset K'$ and a
valuation ring $A' \subset K'$ dominating $A$, and a morphism
$\text{Spec}(A') \to X$ fitting into the commutative diagram.
Since $A'$ dominates $A$, and $A$ dominates $\mathcal{O}_{Y, y}$
we see that the closed point of $\text{Spec}(A')$ maps to
a point $x \in X$ with $f(x) = y$ which is a specialization of $x'$.
Hence $x \in T$ as $T$ is closed, and hence $y \in f(T)$ as desired.
\end{proof}

\noindent
We also want to prove the converse of
Lemma \ref{lemma-quasi-compact-existence-universally-closed}.
Namely, we would like to show, under additional conditions, that
a quasi-compact morphism is universallly closed if and only if
the existence part of the valuative criterion holds.
Example \ref{example-strange-universally-closed} shows that
$[\mathbf{A}^1_k/\mathbf{Z}] \to \text{Spec}(k)$ is universally
closed, but it is easy to see that the existence part of
the valuative criterion fails. Hence some
additional hypothesis is needed. (See also
Lemma \ref{lemma-re-characterize-universally-closed}
for a slight weakening of the hypothesis.)

\begin{proposition}
\label{proposition-characterize-universally-closed}
Let $S$ be a scheme.
Let $f : X \to Y$ be a morphism of algebraic spaces over $S$.
Assume
\begin{enumerate}
\item $f$ is quasi-compact, and
\item $X$ has property $(\gamma)$ of
Properties of Spaces, Lemma \ref{spaces-properties-lemma-bounded-fibres}.
\end{enumerate}
Then $f$ is universally closed if and only if the
existence part of the valuative criterion holds.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
In Lemma \ref{lemma-quasi-compact-existence-universally-closed}
we have seen one of the implications.
To prove the other, assume that $f$ is universally closed. Let
$$
\xymatrix{
\text{Spec}(K) \ar[r] \ar[d] & X \ar[d] \\
\text{Spec}(A) \ar[r] & Y
}
$$
be a diagram as in
Definition \ref{definition-valuative-criterion}.
Let $X_A = \text{Spec}(A) \times_Y X$, so that we have
$$
\xymatrix{
\text{Spec}(K) \ar[r] \ar[rd] & X_A \ar[d] \\
 & \text{Spec}(A)
}
$$
By Lemma \ref{lemma-base-change-quasi-compact} we see that
$X_A \to \text{Spec}(A)$ is quasi-compact. Since $X_A \to X$
is representable, we see that $X_A$ has property $(\gamma)$ also, see
Properties of Spaces,
Lemma \ref{spaces-properties-lemma-representable-properties}.
Moreover, as $f$ is universally closed, we see that $X_A \to \text{Spec}(A)$
is universally closed.
Hence we may and do replace $X$ by $X_A$ and $Y$ by $\text{Spec}(A)$.

\medskip\noindent
Let $x' \in |X|$ be the equivalence class of
$\text{Spec}(K) \to X$. Let $y \in |Y| = |\text{Spec}(A)|$ be
the closed point. Set $y' = f(x')$; it is the generic point of
$\text{Spec}(A)$. Since $f$ is universally closed we see that
$f(\overline{\{x'\}})$ contains $\overline{\{y'\}}$, and hence
contains $y$. Let $x \in \overline{\{x'\}}$ be a point such that
$f(x) = y$. Let $U$ be a scheme, and $\varphi : U \to X$
an etale morphism such that there exists a $u \in U$ with
$\varphi(u) = x$. By
Properties of Spaces, Lemma \ref{spaces-properties-lemma-specialization}
and our assumption that $X$ has property $(\gamma)$
there exists a specialization $u' \leadsto u$ on $U$ with $\varphi(u') = x'$.
This means that there exists a common field extension
$K \subset K' \supset \kappa(u')$ such that
$$
\xymatrix{
\text{Spec}(K') \ar[r] \ar[d] & U \ar[d] \\
\text{Spec}(K) \ar[r] \ar[rd] & X \ar[d] \\
 & \text{Spec}(A)
}
$$
is commutative. This gives the following commutative diagram of rings
$$
\xymatrix{
K' & \mathcal{O}_{U, u} \ar[l] \\
K \ar[u] & \\
 & A \ar[lu] \ar[uu]
}
$$
By
Algebra, Lemma \ref{algebra-lemma-dominate}
we can find a valuation ring $A' \subset K'$ dominating the image of
$\mathcal{O}_{U, u}$ in $K'$. Since by construction $\mathcal{O}_{U, u}$
dominates $A$ we see that $A'$ dominates $A$ also. Hence we obtain a diagram
resembling the second diagram of
Definition \ref{definition-valuative-criterion}
and the proposition is proved.
\end{proof}













\section{Separation axioms}
\label{section-separation-axioms}

\noindent
It makes sense to list some a priori properties of the diagonal of
a morphism of algebraic spaces.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-properties-diagonal}
Let $S$ be a scheme contained in $\textit{Sch}_{fppf}$.
Let $f : X \to Y$ be a morphism of algebraic spaces over $S$.
Let $\Delta_{X/Y} : X \to X \times_Y X$ be the diagonal morphism.
Then
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\Delta_{X/Y}$ is representable,
\item $\Delta_{X/Y}$ is locally of finite type,
\item $\Delta_{X/Y}$ is a monomorphism,
\item $\Delta_{X/Y}$ is separated, and
\item $\Delta_{X/Y}$ is locally quasi-finite.
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
We are going to use the fact that $\Delta_{X/S}$ is
representable (by definition of an algebraic space) and that
it satisfies properties (2) -- (5), see
Spaces, Lemma \ref{spaces-lemma-properties-diagonal}.
Note that we have a factorization
$$
X
\longrightarrow
X \times_Y X
\longrightarrow
X \times_S X
$$
of the diagonal $\Delta_{X/S} : X \to X \times_S X$. Since
$X \times_Y X \to X \times_S X$ is a monomorphism, and since
$\Delta_{X/S}$ is representable, it follows formally that
$\Delta_{X/Y}$ is representable. In particular, the rest of
the statements now make sense, by the discussion in
Section \ref{section-representable}.

\medskip\noindent
Choose a surjective etale morphism $U \to X$, with $U$ a scheme.
Consider the diagram
$$
\xymatrix{
R = U \times_X U \ar[r] \ar[d] &
U \times_Y U \ar[d] \ar[r] &
U \times_S U \ar[d] \\
X \ar[r] & X \times_Y X \ar[r] & X \times_S X
}
$$
Both squares are cartesian, hence so is the outer retangle.
The top row consists of schemes, and the vertical arrows
are surjective etale morphisms. By
Spaces, Lemma \ref{spaces-lemma-representable-morphisms-spaces-property}
the properties (2) -- (5) for $\Delta_{X/Y}$ are equivalent to those of
$R \to U \times_Y U$. In the proof of
Spaces, Lemma \ref{spaces-lemma-properties-diagonal}
we have seen that $R \to U \times_S U$ has properties (2) -- (5).
The morphism $U \times_Y U \to U \times_S U$ is a monomorphism
of schemes. These facts imply that $R \to U \times_S U$ have
properties (2) -- (5).

\medskip\noindent
Namely: For (3), note that $R \to U \times_Y U$
is a monomorphism as the composition
$R \to U \times_S U$ is a monomorphism. For (2), note that
$R \to U \times_Y U$ is locally of finite type, as the
composition $R \to U \times_S U$ is locally of finite type
(Morphisms, Lemma \ref{morphisms-lemma-permanence-finite-type}).
A monomorphism which is locally of finite type is locally quasi-finite
because it has finite fibres
(Morphisms, Lemma \ref{morphisms-lemma-finite-fibre}), hence (5).
A monomorphism is separated
(Schemes, Lemma \ref{schemes-lemma-monomorphism-separated}), hence (4).
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}
\label{definition-separated}
Let $S$ be a scheme.
Let $f : X \to Y$ be a morphism of algebraic spaces over $S$.
Let $\Delta_{X/Y} : X \to X \times_Y X$ be the diagonal morphism.
\begin{enumerate}
\item We say $f$ is {\it separated} if $\Delta_{X/Y}$ is a closed immersion.
\item We say $f$ is {\it locally separated}\footnote{In the literature
this term often refers to quasi-separated and locally separated morphisms.}
if $\Delta_{X/Y}$ is an immersion.
\item We say $f$ is {\it quasi-separated} if $\Delta_{X/Y}$ is quasi-compact.
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

\noindent
This definition makes sense since $\Delta_{X/Y}$ is representable,
and hence we know what it means for it to have one of the properties
described in the definition. We will see below
(Lemma \ref{lemma-match-separated}) that this definition matches the ones
we already have for morphisms of schemes and representable morphisms.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-trivial-implications}
Let $S$ be a scheme.
Let $f : X \to Y$ be a morphism of algebraic spaces over $S$.
We have the following implications among the separation axioms
of Definition \ref{definition-separated}:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $f$ separated implies all the others.
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Omitted.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-base-change-separated}
All of the separation axioms listed in Defintion \ref{definition-separated}
are stable under base change.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Let $f : X \to Y$ and $Y' \to Y$ be morphisms of algebraic spaces.
Let $f' : X' \to Y'$ be the base change of $f$ by $Y' \to Y$. Then
$\Delta_{X'/Y'}$ is the base change of $\Delta_{X/Y}$ by
the morphism $X' \times_{Y'} X' \to X \times_Y X$. By the results of
Section \ref{section-representable}
each of the properties of the diagonal used in
Definition \ref{definition-separated}
is stable under base change. Hence the lemma is true.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-fibre-product-after-map}
Let $S$ be a scheme. Let $f : X \to Z$, $g : Y \to Z$ and $Z \to T$
be morphisms of algebraic spaces over $S$. Consider the induced morphism
$i : X \times_Z Y \to X \times_T Y$. Then
\begin{enumerate}
\item $i$ is representable, locally of finite type, locally quasi-finite,
separated and a monomorphism,
\item if $Z \to T$ is locally separated, then $i$ is an immersion,
\item if $Z \to T$ is separated, then $i$ is a closed immersion, and
\item if $Z \to T$ is quasi-separated, then $i$ is quasi-compact.
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
By general category theory the following diagram
$$
\xymatrix{
X \times_Z Y \ar[r]_i \ar[d] & X \times_T Y \ar[d] \\
Z \ar[r]^-{\Delta_{Z/T}} \ar[r] & Z \times_T Z
}
$$
is a fibre product diagram. Hence $i$ is the base change of the
diagonal morphism $\Delta_{Z/T}$. Thus the lemma follows
from Lemma \ref{lemma-properties-diagonal}, and the material in
Section \ref{section-representable}.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-semi-diagonal}
Let $S$ be a scheme. Let $T$ be an algebraic space over $S$.
Let $g : X \to Y$ be a morphism of algebraic spaces over $T$.
Consider the graph $i : X \to X \times_T Y$ of $g$. Then
\begin{enumerate}
\item $i$ is representable, locally of finite type, locally quasi-finite,
separated and a monomorphism,
\item if $Y \to T$ is locally separated, then $i$ is an immersion,
\item if $Y \to T$ is separated, then $i$ is a closed immersion, and
\item if $Y \to T$ is quasi-separated, then $i$ is quasi-compact.
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
This is a special case of Lemma \ref{lemma-fibre-product-after-map}
applied to the morphism $X = X \times_Y Y \to X\times_T Y$.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-section-immersion}
Let $S$ be a schemes.
Let $f : X \to T$ be a morphism of algebraic spaces over $S$.
Let $s : T \to X$ be a section of $f$ (in a formula
$f \circ s = \text{id}_T$). Then
\begin{enumerate}
\item $s$ is representable, locally of finite type, locally quasi-finite,
separated and a monomorphism,
\item if $f$ is locally separated, then $i$ is an immersion,
\item if $f$ is separated, then $i$ is a closed immersion, and
\item if $f$ is quasi-separated, then $i$ is quasi-compact.
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
This is a special case of Lemma \ref{lemma-semi-diagonal} applied to
$g = s$ so the morphism $i = s : T \to T \times_T X$.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-composition-separated}
All of the separation axioms listed in Defintion \ref{definition-separated}
are stable under composition of morphisms.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Let $f : X \to Y$ and $g : Y \to Z$ be morphisms of algebraic spaces
to which the axiom in question applies.
The diagonal $\Delta_{X/Z}$ is the composition
$$
X \longrightarrow X \times_Y X \longrightarrow X \times_Z X.
$$
Our separation axiom is defined by requiring the diagonal
to have some property $\mathcal{P}$. By
Lemma \ref{lemma-fibre-product-after-map} above we see that
the second arrow also has this property. Hence the lemma follows
since the composition of (representable) morphisms with property
$\mathcal{P}$ also is a morphism with property $\mathcal{P}$, see
Section \ref{section-representable}.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-compose-after-separated}
Let $S$ be a scheme.
Let $f : X \to Y$ and $g : Y \to Z$ be morphisms of algebraic spaces over $S$.
\begin{enumerate}
\item If $g \circ f$ is separated then so is $f$.
\item If $g \circ f$ is locally separated then so is $f$.
\item If $g \circ f$ is quasi-separated then so is $f$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Consider the factorization
$$
X \to X \times_Y X \to X \times_Z X
$$
of the diagonal morphism of $g \circ f$. In any case the last morphism
is a monomorphism. Hence for any scheme $T$ and morphism
$T \to X \times_Y X$ we have the equality
$$
X \times_{(X \times_Y X)} T = X \times_{(X \times_Z X)} T.
$$
Hence the result is clear.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-separated-local}
Let $S$ be a scheme.
Let $f : X \to Y$ be a morphism of algebraic spaces over $S$.
Let $\mathcal{P}$ be any of the separation
axioms of Definition \ref{definition-separated}.
The following are equivalent
\begin{enumerate}
\item $f$ is $\mathcal{P}$,
\item for every scheme $Z$ and morphism $Z \to Y$ the
base change $Z \times_Y X \to Z$ of $f$ is $\mathcal{P}$,
\item for every affine scheme $Z$ and every morphism $Z \to Y$ the
base change $Z \times_Y X \to Z$ of $f$ is $\mathcal{P}$,
\item for every affine scheme $Z$ and every morphism $Z \to Y$ the
algebraic space $Z \times_Y X$ is $\mathcal{P}$ (see
Properties of Spaces, Definition \ref{spaces-properties-definition-separated}),
\item there exists a scheme $V$ and a surjective etale morphism
$V \to Y$ such that the base change $V \times_Y X \to V$ has
$\mathcal{P}$, and
\item there exists a Zariski covering $Y = \bigcup Y_i$ such that each
of the morphisms $f^{-1}(Y_i) \to Y_i$ has $\mathcal{P}$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
We will repeatedly use
Lemma \ref{lemma-base-change-separated}
without further mention. In particular, it is clear that
(1) implies (2) and (2) implies (3).

\medskip\noindent
Let us prove that (3) and (4) are equivalent. Note that if $Z$ is an affine
scheme, then the morphism $Z \to \text{Spec}(\mathbf{Z})$ is a separated
morphism as a morphism of algebraic spaces over $\text{Spec}(\mathbf{Z})$.
If $Z \times_Y X \to Z$ is $\mathcal{P}$, then
$Z \times_Y X \to \text{Spec}(\mathbf{Z})$ is $\mathcal{P}$
as a composition (see
Lemma \ref{lemma-composition-separated}). Hence the algebraic
space $Z \times_Y X$ is $\mathcal{P}$. Conversely, if the algebraic
space $Z \times_Y X$ is $\mathcal{P}$, then
$Z \times_Y X \to \text{Spec}(\mathbf{Z})$ is $\mathcal{P}$, and
hence by
Lemma \ref{lemma-compose-after-separated}
we see that $Z \times_Y X \to Z$ is $\mathcal{P}$.

\medskip\noindent
Let us prove that (3) implies (5). Assume (3). Let $V$ be a scheme
and let $V \to Y$ be etale surjective. We have to show that
$V \times_Y X \to V$ has property $\mathcal{P}$. In other words,
we have to show that the morphism
$$
V \times_Y X \longrightarrow
(V \times_Y X) \times_V (V \times_Y X) = V \times_Y X \times_Y X
$$
has the corresponding property (i.e., is a closed immersion, immersion,
or quasi-compact). Let $V = \bigcup V_j$ be an
affine open covering of $V$. By assumption we know that each of the morphisms
$$
V_j \times_Y X \longrightarrow V_j \times_Y X \times_Y X
$$
does have the corresponding property. Since being a closed immersion,
immersion, quasi-compact immersion, or quasi-compact is Zariski local
on the target, and since the $V_j$ cover $V$ we get the desired conclusion.

\medskip\noindent
Let us prove that (5) implies (1). Let $V \to Y$ be as in (5).
Then we have the fibre product diagram
$$
\xymatrix{
V \times_Y X \ar[r] \ar[d] &
X \ar[d] \\
V \times_Y X \times_Y X \ar[r] &
X \times_Y X
}
$$
By assumption the left vertical arrow is a closed immersion,
immersion, quasi-compact immersion, or quasi-compact. It follows from
Spaces, Lemma \ref{spaces-lemma-descent-representable-transformations-property}
that also the right vertical arrow is a closed immersion,
immersion, quasi-compact immersion, or quasi-compact.

\medskip\noindent
It is clear that (1) implies (6) by taking the covering $Y = Y$.
Assume $Y = \bigcup Y_i$ is as in (6). Choose schemes $V_i$ and
surjective etale morphisms $V_i \to Y_i$. Note that the morphisms
$V_i \times_Y X \to V_i$ have $\mathcal{P}$ as they are base changes
of the morphisms $f^{-1}(Y_i) \to Y_i$. Set $V = \coprod V_i$.
Then $V \to Y$ is a morphism as in (5) (details omitted). Hence
(6) implies (5) and we are done.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-match-separated}
Let $S$ be a scheme.
Let $f : X \to Y$ be a representable morphism of algebraic spaces over $S$.
\begin{enumerate}
\item The morphism $f$ is locally separated.
\item The morphism $f$ is (quasi-)separated in the sense of
Definition \ref{definition-separated}
above if and only if $f$ is (quasi-)separated in the sense of
Section \ref{section-representable}.
\end{enumerate}
In particular, if $f : X \to Y$ is a morphism of schemes over $S$, then
$f$ is (quasi-)separated in the sense of
Definition \ref{definition-separated}
if and only if $f$ is (quasi-)separated as a morphism of schemes.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
This is the equivalence of (1) and (2) of
Lemma \ref{lemma-separated-local}
combined with the fact that any morphism of schemes is locally separated, see
Schemes, Lemma \ref{schemes-lemma-diagonal-immersion}.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-quasi-compact-permanence}
Let $S$ be a scheme.
Let $f : X \to Y$ and $g : Y \to Z$ be morphisms of algebraic spaces over $S$.
If $g \circ f$ is quasi-compact and $g$ is quasi-separated
then $f$ is quasi-compact.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
This is true because $f$ equals the composition
$(1, f) : X \to X \times_Z Y \to Y$. The first map
is quasi-compact by Lemma \ref{lemma-section-immersion}
because it is a section of the quasi-separated morphism $X \times_Z Y \to X$
(a base change of $g$, see Lemma \ref{lemma-base-change-separated}).
The second map is quasi-compact as it
is the base change of $f$, see
Lemma \ref{lemma-base-change-quasi-compact}.
And compositions of quasi-compact
morphisms are quasi-compact, see Lemma \ref{lemma-composition-quasi-compact}.
\end{proof}






\section{Valuative criterion of separatedness}
\label{section-valuative-separatedness}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-separated-implies-valuative}
Let $S$ be a scheme.
Let $f : X \to Y$ be a morphism of algebraic spaces over $S$.
If $f$ is separated, then $f$ satisfies the uniqueness
part of the valuative criterion.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Let a diagram as in Definition \ref{definition-valuative-criterion}
be given. Suppose there are two distinct morphisms
$a, b : \text{Spec}(A) \to X$ fitting into the diagram.
Let $Z \subset \text{Spec}(A)$ be the equalizer of $a$ and $b$.
Then $Z = \text{Spec}(A) \times_{(a, b), X \times_Y X, \Delta} X$.
If $f$ is separated, then $\Delta$ is a closed immersion, and
this is a closed subscheme of $\text{Spec}(A)$. By assumption it contains
the generic point of $\text{Spec}(A)$. Since $A$ is a domain
this implies $Z = \text{Spec}(A)$. Hence $a = b$ as desired.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-valuative-criterion-separatedness}
(Valuative criterion separatedness.)
Let $S$ be a scheme.
Let $f : X \to Y$ be a morphism of algebraic spaces over $S$.
Assume
\begin{enumerate}
\item the morphism $f$ is quasi-separated, and
\item the morphism $f$ satisfies the uniqueness
part of the valuative criterion.
\end{enumerate}
Then $f$ is separated.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Assumption (1) means $\Delta_{X/Y}$ is quasi-compact.
We claim the morphism
$\Delta_{X/Y} : X \to X \times_Y X$ satisfies the existence
part of the valuative criterion.
Let a solid commutative diagram
$$
\xymatrix{
\text{Spec}(K) \ar[r] \ar[d] & X \ar[d] \\
\text{Spec}(A) \ar[r] \ar@{-->}[ru] & X \times_Y X
}
$$
be given. The lower right arrow corresponds to a
pair of morphisms $a, b : \text{Spec}(A) \to X$ over $Y$.
By assumption (2) we see that $a = b$. Hence using $a$ as the dotted
arrow works. Hence
Lemma \ref{lemma-quasi-compact-existence-universally-closed}
applies, and we see that $\Delta_{X/Y}$ is universally closed.
Since always $\Delta_{X/Y}$ is locally of finite type and
separated, we conclude from
More on Morphisms, Lemma \ref{more-morphisms-lemma-characterize-finite}
that $\Delta_{X/Y}$ is a finite morphism (also, use the
general principle of
Spaces, Lemma
\ref{spaces-lemma-representable-transformations-property-implication}).
At this point $\Delta_{X/Y}$ is a representable, finite monomorphism,
hence a closed immersion by
Morphisms, Lemma \ref{morphisms-lemma-finite-monomorphism-closed}.
\end{proof}






\section{Monomorphisms}
\label{section-monomorphisms}

\noindent
A representable morphism $X \to Y$ of algebraic spaces is a monomorphism
according to Section \ref{section-representable} if for every scheme
$Z$ and morphism $Z \to Y$ the morphism $Z \times_Y X \to Z$
is representable by a monomorphism of schemes.
This means exactly that $Z \times_Y X \to Z$
is an injective map of sheaves on $(\textit{Sch}/S)_{fppf}$. Since this
is supposed to hold for all $Z$ and all maps $Z \to Y$ this is in turn
equivalent to the map $X \to Y$ being an injective map of sheaves on
$(\textit{Sch}/S)_{fppf}$. Thus we may define a monomorphism of a (possibly
nonrepresentable) morphism of algebraic spaces as follows.

\begin{definition}
\label{definition-monomorphism}
Let $S$ be a scheme.
A morphism of algebraic spaces over $S$ is called a {\it monomorphism}
if it is an injective map of sheaves, i.e., a monomorphism in the category
of sheaves on $(\textit{Sch}/S)_{fppf}$.
\end{definition}

\noindent
The following lemma shows that this also means that it is a monomorphism
in the category of algebraic spaces over $S$.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-monomorphism}
Let $S$ be a scheme.
Let $j : X \to Y$ be a morphism of algebraic spaces over $S$.
The following are equivalent:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $j$ is a monomorphism (as in Definition \ref{definition-monomorphism}),
\item $j$ is a monomorphism in the category of algebraic spaces over $S$, and
\item the diagonal morphism $\Delta_{X/Y} : X \to X \times_Y X$ is
an isomorphism.
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Note that $X \times_Y X$ is both the fibre product in the category of
sheaves on $(\textit{Sch}/S)_{fppf}$ and the fibre product in the category
of algebraic spaces over $S$, see
Spaces, Lemma \ref{spaces-lemma-fibre-product-spaces}.
The equivalence of (1) and (3) is a general characterization
of injective maps of sheaves on any site.
The equivalence of (2) and (3) is a characterization of monomorphisms
in any category with fibre products.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-monomorphism-separated}
A monomorphism of algebraic spaces is separated.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
This is true because an isomorphism is a closed immersion,
and Lemma \ref{lemma-monomorphism} above.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-composition-monomorphism}
A composition of monomorphisms is a monomorpism.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
True because a composition of injective sheaf maps is injective.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-base-change-monomorphism}
The base change of a monomorphism is a monomorphism.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
This is a general fact about fibre products in a category of sheaves.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-monomorphism-local}
Let $S$ be a scheme.
Let $f : X \to Y$ be a morphism of algebraic spaces over $S$.
The following are equivalent
\begin{enumerate}
\item $f$ is a monomorphism,
\item for every scheme $Z$ and morphism $Z \to Y$ the
base change $Z \times_Y X \to Z$ of $f$ is a monomorphism,
\item for every affine scheme $Z$ and every morphism $Z \to Y$ the
base change $Z \times_Y X \to Z$ of $f$ is a monomorphism,
\item there exists a scheme $V$ and a surjective etale morphism
$V \to Y$ such that the base change $V \times_Y X \to V$ is a
monomorphism, and
\item there exists a Zariski covering $Y = \bigcup Y_i$ such that each
of the morphisms $f^{-1}(Y_i) \to Y_i$ is a monomorphism.
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
We will use without further mention that a base change of a monomorphism
is a monomorphism, see
Lemma \ref{lemma-base-change-monomorphism}.
In particular it is clear that
(1) $\Rightarrow$ (2) $\Rightarrow$ (3) $\Rightarrow$ (4)
(by taking $V$ to be a disjoint union of affine schemes etale over $Y$, see
Properties of Spaces,
Lemma \ref{spaces-properties-lemma-cover-by-union-affines}).
Let $V$ be a scheme, and let $V \to Y$ be a surjective etale morphism.
If $V \times_Y X \to V$ is a monomorphism, then it
follows that $X \to Y$ is a monomorphism. Namely, given any
cartesian diagram of sheaves
$$
\vcenter{
\xymatrix{
\mathcal{F} \ar[r]_a \ar[d]_b & \mathcal{G} \ar[d]^c \\
\mathcal{H} \ar[r]^d & \mathcal{I}
}
}
\quad
\quad
\mathcal{F} = \mathcal{H} \times_\mathcal{I} \mathcal{G}
$$
if $c$ is a surjection of sheaves, and $a$ is injective, then also
$d$ is injective. Thus (4) implies (1). Proof of the equivalence of
(5) and (1) is omitted.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-immersions-monomorphisms}
An immersion of algebraic spaces is a monomorphism.
In particular, any immersion is separated.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Let $f : X \to Y$ be an immersion of algebraic spaces.
For any morphism $Z \to Y$ with $Z$ representable the base
change $Z \times_Y X \to Z$ is an immersion of schemes, hence
a monomorphism, see
Schemes, Lemma \ref{schemes-lemma-immersions-monomorphisms}.
Hence $f$ is representable, and a monomorphism.
\end{proof}










\section{Relative conditions}
\label{section-relative-conditions}

\noindent
This is a (yet another) technical section dealing with conditions on
algebraic spaces having to do with points. It is probably a good idea
to skip this section.

\begin{definition}
\label{definition-relative-conditions}
Let $S$ be a scheme.
\begin{enumerate}
\item We say an algebraic space $X$ over $S$ {\it has
property $(\beta)$, $(\gamma)$, $(\delta)$, or $(\epsilon)$} if $X$
has the corresponding property of
Properties of Spaces, Lemma \ref{spaces-properties-lemma-bounded-fibres}.
\item An algebraic space which has $(\gamma)$ is called {\it decent}, see
Properties of Spaces,
Definition \ref{spaces-properties-definition-very-reasonable}.
\item An algebraic space which has $(\delta)$ is called {\it reasonable}, see
Properties of Spaces,
Definition \ref{spaces-properties-definition-very-reasonable}.
\item An algebraic space which has $(\epsilon)$ is called
{\it very reasonable}, see
Properties of Spaces,
Definition \ref{spaces-properties-definition-very-reasonable}.
\item Let $f : X \to Y$ be a morphism of algebraic spaces over $S$.
We say $f$ {\it has property $(\beta)$, $(\gamma)$, $(\delta)$,
or $(\epsilon)$} if for any scheme $T$ and morphism $T \to Y$
the fibre product $T \times_Y X$ has the corresponding property.
\item A morphism $f$ which has property $(\gamma)$ is called a
{\it decent morphism}.
\item A morphism $f$ which has property $(\delta)$ is called a
{\it reasonable morphism}.
\item A morphism $f$ which has property $(\epsilon)$ is called a
{\it very reasonable morphism}.
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

\noindent
We refer to Remark \ref{remark-very-reasonable} for an informal discussion.
It will turn out that the class of very reasonable morphisms is not so
useful, but that the classes of decent and reasonable morphisms are useful.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-properties-trivial-implications}
Let $S$ be a scheme.
Let $f : X \to Y$ be a morphism of algebraic spaces over $S$.
We have the following implications among the conditions on $f$:
$$
\xymatrix{
\text{representable} \ar@{=>}[rd] & & & & \\
& \text{very reasonable} \ar@{=>}[r] & \text{reasonable} \ar@{=>}[r] &
\text{decent} \ar@{=>}[r] & (\beta) \\
\text{quasi-separated} \ar@{=>}[ru] & & & &
}
$$
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
This is clear from the definitions,
Properties of Spaces, Lemma \ref{spaces-properties-lemma-bounded-fibres}
and
Lemma \ref{lemma-separated-local}.
\end{proof}


\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-base-change-relative-conditions}
Having property $(\beta)$, $(\gamma)$, $(\delta)$, or $(\epsilon)$
is preserved under arbitrary base change.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Omitted.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-composition-relative-conditions}
Having property $(\beta)$, $(\gamma)$, or $(\delta)$
is preserved under compositions.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Let $\omega \in \{\beta, \gamma, \delta\}$.
Let $f : X \to Y$ and $g : Y \to Z$ be morphisms of algebraic spaces
over the scheme $S$. Assume $f$ and $g$ both have property
$(\omega)$. Then we have to show
that for any scheme $T$ and morphism $T \to Z$ the space $T \times_Z X$
has $(\omega)$. By
Lemma \ref{lemma-base-change-relative-conditions}
this reduces us to the following claim: Suppose that $Y$ is an algebraic
space having property $(\omega)$, and that $f : X \to Y$ is a morphism
with $(\omega)$. Then $X$ has $(\omega)$.

\medskip\noindent
Let us prove the claim in case $\omega = \beta$. In this case we have to show
that any $x \in |X|$ is represented by a monomorphism from the spectrum
of a field into $X$. Let $y = f(x) \in |Y|$. By assumption there exists
a field $k$ and a monomorphism $\text{Spec}(k) \to Y$ representing $y$.
Then $x$ corresponds to a point $x'$ of $\text{Spec}(k) \times_Y X$.
By assumption $x'$ is represented by a monomorphism
$\text{Spec}(k') \to \text{Spec}(k) \times_Y X$. Clearly the composition
$\text{Spec}(k') \to X$ is a monomorphism representing $x$.

\medskip\noindent
Let us prove the claim in case $\omega = \gamma$.
Let $x \in |X|$ and $y = f(x) \in |Y|$. By the result of the preceding
paragraph we can choose a diagram
$$
\xymatrix{
\text{Spec}(k') \ar[r]_x \ar[d] & X \ar[d]^f \\
\text{Spec}(k) \ar[r]^y & Y
}
$$
with horizontal arrows monomorphisms. We are going to denote
fibre products of the form $\text{Spec}(k) \times_{y, Y} ?$,
resp.\ $\text{Spec}(k') \times_{x, X} ?$ by $?_y$, resp.\ $?_x$.
Choose an affine scheme $V$ and etale morphism $V \to Y$
such that $V_y$ is not empty. Choose an affine scheme $U$ and an
etale morphism $U \to V \times_Y X$ such that
$U_x$ is not empty. Picture:
$$
\xymatrix{
U \ar[r] \ar[rd] & V \times_Y X \ar[d] \ar[r] & X \ar[d]^f \\
 & V \ar[r] & Y
}
$$
The assumption $(\gamma)$ for $Y$ implies that $V_y$ is a finite scheme
over $k$ and the assumption $(\gamma)$ for $f$ (applied to the base change
of $f$ by $V_y \to Y$) implies the fibres of
$U_x \to \text{Spec}(k') \times_{\text{Spec}(k)} V_y = (V \times_Y X)_x$
are finite. Note that the morphism
$U_x \to \text{Spec}(k') \times_{\text{Spec}(k)} V_y$ is etale.
Hence the scheme $U_x$ is finite. Now the collection of all etale morphisms
$U \to X$ with $U$ affine which either are of the form above, or have
$U_x = \emptyset$ cover $X$. Hence this collection is a collection of
morphisms as in
Properties of Spaces,
Lemma \ref{spaces-properties-lemma-UR-finite-above-x} part (3).
As the point $x$ was arbitrary this implies $(\gamma)$ holds for $X$.

\medskip\noindent
Let us prove the claim in case $\omega = \delta$.
Choose $V \to Y$ etale with $V$ an affine scheme.
Choose $U \to V \times_Y X$ etale with $U$ an affine scheme.
By assumption $V \to Y$ has universally bounded fibres. By
Properties of Spaces,
Lemma \ref{spaces-properties-lemma-base-change-universally-bounded}
$V \times_Y X \to X$ has universally bounded fibres.
By assumption on $f$ we see that $U \to V \times_Y X$ has
universally bounded fibres. By
Properties of Spaces,
Lemma \ref{spaces-properties-lemma-composition-universally-bounded}
the composition $U \to X$ has universally bounded fibres.
Hence there exists sufficiently many etale morphisms $U \to X$
from schemes with universally bounded fibres, and we conclude
that $X$ has property $(\delta)$.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-descent-conditions}
Let $S$ be a scheme.
Let $f : X \to Y$ be a morphism of algebraic spaces over $S$.
Let $\mathcal{P} \in \{(\beta), (\gamma), (\delta)\}$.
Assume
\begin{enumerate}
\item $f$ is quasi-compact,
\item $f$ is etale,
\item $|f| : |X| \to |Y|$ is surjective, and
\item the algebraic space $X$ has property $\mathcal{P}$.
\end{enumerate}
Then $Y$ has property $\mathcal{P}$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Let us prove this in case $\mathcal{P} = (\beta)$. Let $y \in |Y|$ be
a point. We have to show that $y$ can be represented by a monomorphism
from a field. Choose a point $x \in |X|$ with $f(x) = y$.
By assumption we may represent $x$ by a monomorphism
$\text{Spec}(k) \to X$, with $k$ a field. By
Properties of Spaces,
Lemma \ref{spaces-properties-lemma-R-finite-above-x}
it suffices to show that the projections
$\text{Spec}(k) \times_Y \text{Spec}(k) \to \text{Spec}(k)$
are etale and quasi-compact. We can factor the first projection as
$$
\text{Spec}(k) \times_Y \text{Spec}(k)
\longrightarrow
\text{Spec}(k) \times_Y X
\longrightarrow
\text{Spec}(k)
$$
The first morphism is a monomorphism, and the second is etale and
quasi-compact. By
Properties of Spaces,
Lemma \ref{spaces-properties-lemma-etale-over-field-scheme}
we see that $\text{Spec}(k) \times_Y X$ is a scheme. Hence it is a
finite disjoint union of spectra of finite separable field extensions
of $k$. By
Schemes, Lemma \ref{schemes-lemma-mono-towards-spec-field}
we see that the first arrow identifies
$\text{Spec}(k) \times_Y \text{Spec}(k)$ with a finite disjoint
union of spectra of finite separable field extensions of $k$.
Hence the projection morphism is etale and quasi-compact.

\medskip\noindent
Let us prove this in case $\mathcal{P} = (\gamma)$.
We have already seen in the first paragraph of the proof that this implies
that every $y \in |Y|$ can be represented by a monomorphism
$y : \text{Spec}(k) \to Y$. Pick such a $y$. Pick an affine
scheme $U$ and an etale morphism $U \to X$ such that the image
of $|U| \to |Y|$ contains $y$. By
Properties of Spaces,
Lemma \ref{spaces-properties-lemma-UR-finite-above-x}
it suffices to show that $U_y$ is a finite scheme over $k$. The fibre
product $X_y = \text{Spec}(k) \times_Y X$ is a quasi-compact etale
algebraic space over $k$. Hence by
Properties of Spaces,
Lemma \ref{spaces-properties-lemma-etale-over-field-scheme}
it is a scheme. So it is a finite disjoint union of spectra of
finite separable extensions of $k$. Say $X_y = \{x_1, \ldots, x_n\}$
so $x_i$ is given by  $x_i : \text{Spec}(k_i) \to X$ with
$[k_i : k] < \infty$. By assumption $X$ has $(\gamma)$, so the schemes
$U_{x_i} = \text{Spec}(k_i) \times_X U$ is finite over $k_i$.
Finally, we note that $U_y = \coprod U_{x_i}$ as a scheme and we conclude
that $U_y$ is finite over $k$ as desired.

\medskip\noindent
Let us prove this in case $\mathcal{P} = (\delta)$.
Pick an affine scheme $V$ and an etale morphism $V \to Y$.
We have the show the fibres of $V \to Y$ are universally bounded.
The algebraic space $V \times_Y X$ is quasi-compact.
Thus we can find an affine scheme $W$ and a surjective etale morphism
$W \to V \times_Y X$, see
Properties of Spaces,
Lemma \ref{spaces-properties-lemma-quasi-compact-affine-cover}.
Here is a picture (solid diagram)
$$
\xymatrix{
W \ar[r]  \ar[rd] &
V \times_Y X \ar[r] \ar[d] &
X \ar[d]_f & \text{Spec}(k) \ar@{..>}[l]^x \ar@{..>}[ld]^y \\
 & V \ar[r] & Y
}
$$
The morphism $W \to X$ is universally bounded by our assumption that
the space $X$ has property $(\delta)$. Let $n$ be an integer bounding
the degrees of the fibres of $W \to X$. We claim that the same integer
works for bounding the fibres of $V \to Y$. Namely, suppose $y \in |Y|$
is a point. Then there exists a $x \in |X|$ with $f(x) = y$ (see above).
This means we can find a field $k$ and morphisms $x, y$ given as dotted
arrows in the diagram above. In particular we get a surjective etale
morphism
$$
\text{Spec}(k) \times_{x, X} W
\to
\text{Spec}(k) \times_{x, X} (V \times_Y X) = \text{Spec}(k) \times_{y, Y} V
$$
which shows that the degree of $\text{Spec}(k) \times_{y, Y} V$ over $k$
is less than or equal to the degree of $\text{Spec}(k) \times_{x, X} W$
over $k$, i.e., $\leq n$, and we win. (This last part of the argument
is the same as the argument in the proof of
Properties of Spaces,
Lemma \ref{spaces-properties-lemma-descent-universally-bounded}. Unfortunately
that lemma is not general enough because it only applies to representable
morphisms.)
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-relative-conditions-local}
Let $S$ be a scheme.
Let $f : X \to Y$ be a morphism of algebraic spaces over $S$.
Let $\mathcal{P} \in \{(\beta), (\gamma), (\delta), (\epsilon)\}$.
The following are equivalent
\begin{enumerate}
\item $f$ is $\mathcal{P}$,
\item for every affine scheme $Z$ and every morphism $Z \to Y$ the
base change $Z \times_Y X \to Z$ of $f$ is $\mathcal{P}$,
\item for every affine scheme $Z$ and every morphism $Z \to Y$ the
algebraic space $Z \times_Y X$ is $\mathcal{P}$, and
\item there exists a Zariski covering $Y = \bigcup Y_i$ such
that each morphism $f^{-1}(Y_i) \to Y_i$ has $\mathcal{P}$.
\end{enumerate}
If $\mathcal{P} \in \{(\beta), (\gamma), (\delta)\}$, then this is also
equivalent to 
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(4)] there exists a scheme $V$ and a surjective etale morphism
$V \to Y$ such that the base change $V \times_Y X \to V$ has
$\mathcal{P}$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
The implications (1) $\Rightarrow$ (2) $\Rightarrow$ (3) $\Rightarrow$ (4)
are trivial.
The implication (3) $\Rightarrow$ (1) can be seen as follows.
Let $Z \to Y$ be a morphism whose source is a scheme over $S$.
Consider the algebraic space $Z \times_Y X$. If we assume (3), then
for any affine open $W \subset Z$, the open subspace
$W \times_Y X$ of $Z \times_Y X$ has property $\mathcal{P}$. Hence by
Properties of Spaces, Lemma \ref{spaces-properties-lemma-properties-local}
the space $Z \times_Y X$ has property $\mathcal{P}$, i.e., (1) holds.
A similar argument (omitted) shows that (4) implies (1).

\medskip\noindent
The implication (1) $\Rightarrow$ (5) is trivial. Let $V \to Y$ be
an etale morphism from a scheme as in (5). Let $Z$ be an affine scheme,
and let $Z \to Y$ be a morphism. Consider the diagram
$$
\xymatrix{
Z \times_Y V \ar[r]_q \ar[d]_p & V \ar[d] \\
Z \ar[r] & Y
}
$$
Since $p$ is etale, and hence open, we can choose finitely many affine open
subschemes $W_i \subset Z \times_Y V$ such that $Z = \bigcup p(W_i)$.
Consider the commutative diagram
$$
\xymatrix{
V \times_Y X \ar[d] &
(\coprod W_i) \times_Y X \ar[l] \ar[d] \ar[r] &
Z \times_Y X \ar[d] \\
V &
\coprod W_i \ar[l] \ar[r] &
Z
}
$$
We know $V \times_Y X$ has property $\mathcal{P}$. By 
Properties of Spaces,
Lemma \ref{spaces-properties-lemma-representable-properties}
we see that $(\coprod W_i) \times_Y X$ has property $\mathcal{P}$.
Note that the morphism $(\coprod W_i) \times_Y X \to Z \times_Y X$
is etale and quasi-compact as the base change of $\coprod W_i \to Z$.
Hence by Lemma \ref{lemma-descent-conditions}
we conclude that $Z \times_Y X$ has property $\mathcal{P}$.
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}
\label{remark-very-reasonable}
Informally the properties of
Definition \ref{definition-relative-conditions}
mean the following:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Condition $(\beta)$ on a space means that points are always represented
by monomorphisms from spectra of fields.
\item Condition $(\gamma)$ on a space means that points are always represented
by monomorphisms from spectra of fields and that those monomorphisms are
quasi-compact (insert future reference here). Such a space is called
{\it decent}.
\item Condition $(\delta)$ means $(\gamma)$ $+$ locally on the space exist
etale coverings whose fibres are universally bounded.
\item Very reasonable means there exists a Zariski open covering whose
pieces have coverings $\varphi_i : U_i \to X_i$ which are quasi-compact.
Very reasonable implies $(\delta)$.
\item A morphism has one of these properties if (very) loosely speaking the
fibres of the morphism have the corresponding properties.
\end{enumerate}
Being decent is useful to prove things about specializations of
points on $|X|$. Condition $(\delta)$ is a bit stronger, and technically
quite easy to work with. Very reasonable is a good condition in the sense that
it implies that $X$ has a dense open subspace which is a scheme, and
that $|X|$ is a sober topological space. This is not clear for spaces
which have property $(\delta)$ and probably not true (although see
Properties of Spaces,
Remark \ref{spaces-properties-remark-fun-property-reasonable}
for an interesting additional property of spaces of type $(\delta)$).
On the other hand, we do not know whether the class of very reasonable
morphisms is closed under composition, and we do not know whether
very reasonable spaces satisfy a descent property as the one in
Lemma \ref{lemma-descent-conditions} (even with $f$ assumed representable).
\end{remark}

\noindent
Here is the lemma we promised earlier.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-re-characterize-universally-closed}
Let $S$ be a scheme.
Let $f : X \to Y$ be a morphism of algebraic spaces over $S$.
Assume $f$ is quasi-compact, and $f$ has property $(\gamma)$ (i.e., $f$
is decent).
(For example if $f$ is representable, or quasi-separated, see
Lemma \ref{lemma-properties-trivial-implications}.)
Then $f$ is universally closed if and only if the
existence part of the valuative criterion holds.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
In Lemma \ref{lemma-quasi-compact-existence-universally-closed}
we proved that any quasi-compact morphism which satsifies the existence
part of the valuative criterion is universally closed.
To prove the other, assume that $f$ is universally closed.
In the proof of
Proposition \ref{proposition-characterize-universally-closed}
we have seen that it suffices to show, for any valuation ring $A$,
and any morphism $\text{Spec}(A) \to Y$, that the base change
$f_A : X_A \to \text{Spec}(A)$ satisfies the existence part of the valuative
criterion. By definition the algebraic space $X_A$ has property $(\gamma)$
and hence Proposition \ref{proposition-characterize-universally-closed}
applies to the morphism $f_A$ and we win.
\end{proof}









\section{Pushforward of quasi-coherent sheaves}
\label{section-pushforward}

\noindent
We first prove a simple lemma that relates pushforward of sheaves of modules
for a morphism of algebraic spaces to pushforward of sheaves of modules for
a morphism of schemes.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-compute-pushforward}
Let $S$ be a scheme.
Let $f : X \to Y$ be a morphism of algebraic spaces over $S$.
Let $U \to X$ be a surjective etale morphism from a scheme to $X$.
Set $R = U \times_X U$ and denote $t, s : R \to U$ the projection
morphisms as usual. Denote $a : U \to Y$ and $b : R \to Y$ the induced
morphisms. For any $\mathcal{F} \in \text{Mod}(\mathcal{O}_X)$
there exists an exact sequence
$$
0 \to f_*\mathcal{F} \to a_*(\mathcal{F}|_U) \to b_*(\mathcal{F}|_R)
$$
where the second arrow is the difference $t^* - s^*$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
We denote $\mathcal{F}$ also its extension to a sheaf of modules on
$X_{spaces, etale}$, see
Properties of Spaces,
Remark \ref{spaces-properties-remark-explain-equivalence}.
Let $V \to Y$ be an object of $Y_{etale}$. Then $V \times_Y X$ is an
object of $X_{spaces, etale}$, and by definition
$f_*\mathcal{F}(V) = \mathcal{F}(V \times_Y X)$. Since $U \to X$ is
surjective etale, we see that $\{V \times_Y U \to V \times_Y X\}$
is a covering. Also, we have
$(V \times_Y U) \times_X (V \times_Y U) = V \times_Y R$.
Hence, by the sheaf condition of $\mathcal{F}$ on
$X_{spaces, etale}$ we have a short exact sequence
$$
0 \to \mathcal{F}(V \times_Y X)
\to \mathcal{F}(V \times_Y U) \to \mathcal{F}(V \times_Y R)
$$
where the second arrow is the difference of restricting via $t$ or $s$.
This exact sequence is functorial in $V$ and hence we obtain the lemma.
\end{proof}

\noindent
Here is the main result of this section. In its proof we have to be
a little careful since we are working with sheaves of modules
in the etale topology and we have not yet matched what happens for
these sheaves in the case of a morphism of representable algebraic
spaces with what happens for ``usual'' quasi-coherent sheaves on schemes.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-pushforward}
Let $S$ be a scheme.
Let $f : X \to Y$ be a morphism of algebraic spaces over $S$.
If $f$ is quasi-compact and quasi-separated, then $f_*$ transforms
quasi-coherent $\mathcal{O}_X$-modules into
quasi-coherent $\mathcal{O}_Y$-modules.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Let $\mathcal{F}$ be a quasi-coherent sheaf on $X$. We have to show that
$f_*\mathcal{F}$ is a quasi-coherent sheaf on $Y$. For this it suffices
to show that for any affine scheme $V$ and etale morphism $V \to Y$
the restriction of $f_*\mathcal{F}$ to $V$ is quasi-coherent, see
Properties of Spaces,
Lemma \ref{spaces-properties-lemma-characterize-quasi-coherent}
Let $f' : V \times_Y X \to V$
be the base change of $f$ by $V \to Y$. Note that $f'$ is also
quasi-compact and quasi-separated, see
Lemmas \ref{lemma-base-change-quasi-compact} and
\ref{lemma-base-change-separated}.
By
Properties of Spaces,
Lemma \ref{spaces-properties-lemma-pushforward-etale-base-change-modules}
we know that the restriction of $f_*\mathcal{F}$ to $V$ is $f'_*$ of the
restriction of $\mathcal{F}$ to $V \times_Y X$. Hence by
we may replace $f$ by $f'$, and assume that $Y$ is an affine scheme.

\medskip\noindent
Assume $Y$ is an affine scheme. Since $f$ is quasi-compact we see that $X$
is quasi-compact. Thus we may choose an affine scheme $U$ and a surjective
etale morphism $U \to X$, see
Properties of Spaces,
Lemma \ref{spaces-properties-lemma-quasi-compact-affine-cover}.
By Lemma \ref{lemma-compute-pushforward} we get an exact sequence
$$
0 \to f_*\mathcal{F} \to a_*(\mathcal{F}|_U) \to b_*(\mathcal{F}|_R).
$$
As $X \to Y$ is quasi-separated we see that $R = U \times_X U \to U \times_Y U$
is a quasi-compact monomorphism. This implies that $R$ is a quasi-compact
separated scheme (as $U$ and $Y$ are affine at this point).
Hence the morphisms $a : U \to Y$ and $b : R \to Y$ are quasi-compact and
quasi-separated. In particular,
Descent,
Proposition \ref{descent-proposition-equivalence-quasi-coherent-functorial}
applies! This implies that $f_*\mathcal{F}$ is a kernel of quasi-coherent
modules, and hence itself quasi-coherent, see
Properties of Spaces,
Lemma \ref{spaces-properties-lemma-properties-quasi-coherent}.
\end{proof}

\noindent
At this point we point out that
Descent,
Proposition \ref{descent-proposition-equivalence-quasi-coherent-functorial}
(used in the proof above) also means that if $f : X \to Y$ is a
quasi-compact and quasi-separated morphism of algebraic spaces, and
if $X$ and $Y$ are representable, then the functor
$f_* : \text{QCoh}(X) \to \text{QCoh}(Y)$ agrees with the
usual functor if we think of $X$ and $Y$ as schemes.






\section{Closed immersions}
\label{section-closed-immersions}

\noindent
In this section we elucidate some of the results obtained previously on
immersions of algebraic spaces; it should parallel
Morphisms, Section \ref{morphisms-section-closed-immersions}.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-closed-immersion-ideals}
Let $S$ be a scheme.
Let $X$ be an algebraic space over $S$.
For every closed immersion $i : Z \to X$ the sheaf
$i_*\mathcal{O}_Z$ is a quasi-coherent $\mathcal{O}_X$-module, the map
$i^\sharp : \mathcal{O}_X \to i_*\mathcal{O}_Z$ is surjective and its
kernel is a quasi-coherent sheaf of ideals. The rule
$Z \mapsto \text{Ker}(\mathcal{O}_X \to i_*\mathcal{O}_Z)$
defines an inclusion reversing bijection
$$
\begin{matrix}
\text{closed subschemes}\\
Z \subset X
\end{matrix}
\longrightarrow
\begin{matrix}
\text{quasi-coherent sheaves}\\
\text{of ideals }\mathcal{I} \subset \mathcal{O}_X
\end{matrix}
$$
Moreover, given a closed subscheme $Z$ corresponding to the quasi-coherent
sheaf of ideals $\mathcal{I} \subset \mathcal{O}_X$ a morphism of algebraic
spaces $h : Y \to X$ factors through $Z$ if and only if the map
$h^*\mathcal{I} \to h^*\mathcal{O}_X = \mathcal{O}_Y$ is zero.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Let $U \to X$ be a surjective etale morphism whose source is a scheme.
Consider the diagram
$$
\xymatrix{
U \times_X Z \ar[r] \ar[d]_{i'} & Z \ar[d]^i \\
U \ar[r] & X
}
$$
By
Lemma \ref{lemma-closed-immersion-local}
we see that $i$ is a closed immersion
if and only if $i'$ is a closed immersion. By
Properties of Spaces,
Lemma \ref{spaces-properties-lemma-pushforward-etale-base-change-modules}
we see that $i'_*\mathcal{O}_{U \times_X Z}$ is the restriction of
$i_*\mathcal{O}_Z$ to $U$. Hence the assertions on
$\mathcal{O}_X \to i_*\mathcal{O}_Z$ are equivalent to the
corresponding assertions on
$\mathcal{O}_U \to i'_*\mathcal{O}_{U \times_X Z}$.
And since $i'$ is a closed immersion of schemes, these results follow from
Morphisms, Lemma \ref{morphisms-lemma-closed-immersion}.

\medskip\noindent
Let us prove that given a quasi-coherent
sheaf of ideals $\mathcal{I} \subset \mathcal{O}_X$ the formula
$$
Z(T) = \{h : T \to X \mid h^*\mathcal{I} \to \mathcal{O}_T
\text{ is zero}\}
$$
defines a closed subspace of $X$. It is clearly a subfunctor of $X$.
To show that $Z \to X$ is representable by closed immersions, let
$\varphi : U \to X$ be a morphism from a scheme towards $X$. Then
$Z \times_X U$ is represented by the analogous subfunctor of $U$ corresponding
to the sheaf of ideals $\text{Im}(\varphi^*\mathcal{I} \to \mathcal{O}_U)$. By
Properties of Spaces,
Lemma \ref{spaces-properties-lemma-pullback-quasi-coherent}
the $\mathcal{O}_U$-module $\varphi^*\mathcal{I}$ is quasi-coherent on
on $U$, and hence $\text{Im}(\varphi^*\mathcal{I} \to \mathcal{O}_U)$
is a quasi-coherent sheaf of ideals on $U$. By
Schemes, Lemma \ref{schemes-lemma-characterize-closed-subspace}
we conclude that $Z \times_X U$ is represented by the closed subscheme
of $U$ associated to $\text{Im}(\varphi^*\mathcal{I} \to \mathcal{O}_U)$.
Thus $Z$ is a closed subspace of $X$.

\medskip\noindent
In the formula for $Z$ above the inputs $T$ are schemes since algebraic
spaces are sheaves on $(\textit{Sch}/S)_{fppf}$. We omit the verification
that the same formula remains true if $T$ is an algebraic space.
\end{proof}












\section{Surjective morphisms}
\label{section-surjective}

\noindent
We have already defined in Section \ref{section-representable}
what it means for a representable morphism of algebraic spaces
to be surjective.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-surjective-representable}
Let $S$ be a scheme. Let $f : X \to Y$ be a representable
morphism of algebraic spaces over $S$. Then
$f$ is surjective if and only if $|f| : |X| \to |Y|$ is surjective.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Namely, if $f : X \to Y$ is representable, then it is surjective if and only if
for every scheme $T$ and every morphism $T \to Y$ the base change
$f_T : T \times_Y X \to T$ of $f$ is surjective. By
Properties of spaces, Lemma \ref{spaces-properties-lemma-points-cartesian}
the map $|T \times_Y X| \to |T| \times_{|Y|} |X|$ is always surjective,
Hence $|f_T| : |T \times_Y X| \to |T|$ is surjective if $|f| : |X| \to |Y|$
is surjective. Conversely, if $|f_T|$ is surjective for every
$T \to Y$, then by taking $T$ to be the spectrum of a field we conclude that
$|X| \to |Y|$ is surjective.
\end{proof}

\noindent
This clears the way for the following definition.

\begin{definition}
\label{definition-surjective}
Let $S$ be a scheme. Let $f : X \to Y$ be a morphism of algebraic
spaces over $S$. We say $f$ is {\it surjective}
if the map $|f| : |X| \to |Y|$ of associated topological spaces
is surjective.
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-surjective-local}
Let $S$ be a scheme.
Let $f : X \to Y$ be a morphism of algebraic spaces over $S$.
The following are equivalent:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $f$ is surjective,
\item for every scheme $Z$ and any morphism $Z \to Y$ the morphism
$Z \times_Y X \to Z$ is surjective,
\item for every affine scheme $Z$ and any morphism
$Z \to Y$ the morphism $Z \times_Y X \to Z$ is surjective,
\item there exists a scheme $V$ and a surjective etale morphism
$V \to Y$ such that $V \times_Y X \to V$ is a surjective morphism,
\item there exists a scheme $U$ and a surjective etale morphism
$\varphi : U \to X$ such that the composition $f \circ \varphi$
is surjective,
\item there exists a commutative diagram
$$
\xymatrix{
U \ar[d] \ar[r] & V \ar[d] \\
X \ar[r] & Y
}
$$
where $U$, $V$ are schemes and the vertical arrows are surjective etale
such that the top horizontal arrow is surjective, and
\item there exists a Zariski covering $Y = \bigcup Y_i$ such that
each of the morphisms $f^{-1}(Y_i) \to Y_i$ is surjective.
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Omitted.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-composition-surjective}
The composition of surjective morphisms is surjective.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Omitted.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-base-change-surjective}
The base change of a surjective morphism is surjective.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Omitted. Hint: Use
Properties of spaces, Lemma \ref{spaces-properties-lemma-points-cartesian}.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-surjection-from-quasi-compact}
If $X \to Y$ is a surjective morphism of algebraic spaces,
and $X$ is quasi-compact then $Y$ is quasi-compact.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
By
Definition \ref{definition-surjective}
the map $|X| \to |Y|$ is surjective, hence we win by
Properties of Spaces, Lemma \ref{spaces-properties-lemma-quasi-compact-space}
and the topological fact that the image of a quasi-compact space under a
continuous map is quasi-compact.
\end{proof}






\section{Universally injective morphisms}
\label{section-universally-injective}

\noindent
We have already defined in Section \ref{section-representable}
what it means for a representable morphism of algebraic spaces
to be universally injective. For a field $K$ over $S$ (recall this means that
we are given a structure morphism $\text{Spec}(K) \to S$) and an
algebraic space $X$ over $S$ we write
$X(K) = \text{Mor}_S(\text{Spec}(K), X)$. We first translate the
condition for representable morphisms into a condition on the functor
of points.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-universally-injective-representable}
Let $S$ be a scheme. Let $f : X \to Y$ be a representable
morphism of algebraic spaces over $S$. Then
$f$ is universally injective if and only if for all fields $K$ the
map $X(K) \to Y(K)$ is injective.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
We are going to use
Morphisms, Lemma \ref{morphisms-lemma-universally-injective}
without further mention.
Suppose that $f$ is universally injective. Then for any field $K$ and any
morphism $\text{Spec}(K) \to Y$ the morphism of schemes
$\text{Spec}(K) \times_Y X \to \text{Spec}(K)$ is universally injective.
Hence there exists at most one section of the morphism
$\text{Spec}(K) \times_Y X \to \text{Spec}(K)$. Hence the map
$X(K) \to Y(K)$ is injective. Conversely, suppose that for every field $K$
the map $X(K) \to Y(K)$ is injective. Let $T \to Y$ be a morphism from a
scheme into $Y$, and consider the base change $f_T : T \times_Y X \to T$.
For any field $K$ we have
$$
(T \times_Y X)(K) = T(K) \times_{Y(K)} X(K)
$$
by definition of the fibre product, and hence the injectivity of
$X(K) \to Y(K)$ garantees the injectivity of
$(T \times_Y X)(K) \to T(K)$ which means that $f_T$ is universally injective
as desired.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-universally-injective}
Let $S$ be a scheme.
Let $f : X \to Y$ be a morphism of algebraic spaces over $S$.
The following are equivalent:
\begin{enumerate}
\item the map $X(K) \to Y(K)$ is injective for every field $K$ over $S$
\item for every morphism $Y' \to Y$ of algebraic spaces over $S$
the induced map $|Y' \times_Y X| \to |Y'|$ is injective, and
\item the diagonal morphism $X \to X \times_Y X$ is surjective.
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Assume (1). Let $g : Y' \to Y$ be a morphism of algebraic
spaces, and denote $f' : Y' \times_Y X \to Y'$ the base change of $f$.
Let $K_i$, $i = 1, 2$ be fields and let
$\varphi_i : \text{Spec}(K_i) \to Y' \times_Y X$ be morphisms
such that $f' \circ \varphi_1$ and $f' \circ \varphi_2$ define the
same element of $|Y'|$. By definition this means there exists a
field $\Omega$ and embeddings $\alpha_i : K_i \subset \Omega$ such that
the two morphisms
$f' \circ \varphi_i \circ \alpha_i : \text{Spec}(\Omega) \to Y'$ are equal.
Here is the corresponding commutative diagram
$$
\xymatrix{
\text{Spec}(\Omega) \ar@/_5ex/[ddrr] \ar[rd]^{\alpha_1} \ar[r]_{\alpha_2} &
\text{Spec}(K_2) \ar[rd]^{\varphi_2} \\
& \text{Spec}(K_1) \ar[r]^{\varphi_1} &
Y' \times_Y X  \ar[d]^{f'} \ar[r]^{g'} &
 X \ar[d]^f \\
& & Y' \ar[r]^g & Y.
}
$$
In particular the compositions $g \circ f' \circ \varphi_i \circ \alpha_i$
are equal. By assumption (1) this implies that the morphism
$g' \circ \varphi_i \circ \alpha_i$ are equal, where $g' : Y' \times_Y X \to X$
is the projection. By the universal property of the fibre product we conclude
that the morphisms
$\varphi_i \circ \alpha_i : \text{Spec}(\Omega) \to Y' \times_Y X$ are
equal. In other words $\varphi_1$ and $\varphi_2$ define the same point
of $Y' \times_Y X$. We conclude that (2) holds.

\medskip\noindent
Assume (2). Let $K$ be a field over $S$, and let $a, b : \text{Spec}(K) \to X$
be two morphisms such that $f \circ a = f \circ b$. Denote
$c : \text{Spec}(K) \to Y$ the common value. By assumption
$|\text{Spec}(K) \times_{c, Y} X| \to |\text{Spec}(K)|$ is injective.
This means there exists a field $\Omega$ and embeddings
$\alpha_i : K \to \Omega$ such that
$$
\xymatrix{
\text{Spec}(\Omega) \ar[r]_{\alpha_1} \ar[d]_{\alpha_2} &
\text{Spec}(K) \ar[d]^a \\
\text{Spec}(K) \ar[r]^-b &
\text{Spec}(K) \times_{c, Y} X
}
$$
is commutative. Composing with the projection to $\text{Spec}(K)$
we see that $\alpha_1 = \alpha_2$. Denote the common value $\alpha$.
Then we see that $\{\alpha : \text{Spec}(\Omega) \to \text{Spec}(K)\}$
is a fpqc covering of $\text{Spec}(K)$ such that the two morphisms
$a, b$ become equal on the members of the covering. By
Properties of Spaces, Lemma \ref{spaces-properties-lemma-separated-fpqc}
we conclude that $a = b$. We conclude that (1) holds.

\medskip\noindent
Assume (3). Let $x, x' \in |X|$ be a pair of points such that
$f(x) = f(x')$ in $|Y|$. By
Properties of Spaces, Lemma \ref{spaces-properties-lemma-points-cartesian}
we see there exists a $x'' \in |X \times_Y X|$ whose projections
are $x$ and $x'$. By assumption and
Properties of Spaces,
Lemma \ref{spaces-properties-lemma-characterize-surjective}
there exists a $x''' \in |X|$ with $\Delta_{X/Y}(x''') = x''$.
Thus $x = x'$. In other words $f$ is injective.
Since condition (3) is stable under base change we see that $f$
satsifies (2).

\medskip\noindent
Assume (2). Then in particular $|X \times_Y X| \to |X|$ is injective
which implies immediately that
$|\Delta_{X/Y}| : |X| \to |X \times_Y X|$ is surjective, which
implies that $\Delta_{X/Y}$ is surjective by
Properties of Spaces,
Lemma \ref{spaces-properties-lemma-characterize-surjective}.
\end{proof}

\noindent
These considerations clear the way for the following definition.

\begin{definition}
\label{definition-universally-injective}
Let $S$ be a scheme. Let $f : X \to Y$ be a morphism of algebraic
spaces over $S$. We say $f$ is {\it universally injective} if
for every morphism $Y' \to Y$ the induced map
$|Y' \times_Y X| \to |Y'|$ is injective.
\end{definition}

\noindent
To be sure this means that the equivalent conditions of
Lemma \ref{lemma-universally-injective} hold.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-base-change-universally-injective}
The base change of a universally injective morphism is universally injective.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Omitted. Hint: This is formal.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-universally-injective-local}
Let $S$ be a scheme.
Let $f : X \to Y$ be a morphism of algebraic spaces over $S$.
The following are equivalent:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $f$ is universally injective,
\item for every scheme $Z$ and any morphism $Z \to Y$ the morphism
$Z \times_Y X \to Z$ is universally injective,
\item for every affine scheme $Z$ and any morphism
$Z \to Y$ the morphism $Z \times_Y X \to Z$ is universally injective,
\item there exists a scheme $Z$ and a surjective morphism
$Z \to Y$ such that $Z \times_Y X \to Z$ is universally injective, and
\item there exists a Zariski covering $Y = \bigcup Y_i$ such that
each of the morphisms $f^{-1}(Y_i) \to Y_i$ is universally injective.
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
We will use that being universally injective is preserved under base change
(Lemma \ref{lemma-base-change-universally-injective})
without further mention in this proof.
It is clear that (1) $\Rightarrow$ (2) $\Rightarrow$ (3)
$\Rightarrow$ (4).

\medskip\noindent
Assume $g : Z \to Y$ as in (4). Let $y : \text{Spec}(K) \to Y$ be a
morphism from the spectrum of a field into $Y$. By assumption we
can find an extension field $\alpha : K \subset K'$ and a morphism
$z : \text{Spec}(K') \to Z$ such that $y \circ \alpha = g \circ z$
(with obvious abuse of notation). By assumption the
morphism $Z \times_Y X \to Z$ is universally injective, hence there
is at most one
lift of $g \circ z : \text{Spec}(K') \to Y$ to a morphism into $X$.
Since $\{\alpha : \text{Spec}(K') \to \text{Spec}(K)\}$ is a
fpqc covering this implies there is at most one lift of
$y : \text{Spec}(K) \to Y$ to a morphism into $X$, see
Properties of Spaces, Lemma \ref{spaces-properties-lemma-separated-fpqc}.
Thus we see that (1) holds.

\medskip\noindent
We omit the verification that (5) is equivalent to (1).
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-composition-universally-injective}
A composition of universally injective morphisms is universally injective.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Omitted.
\end{proof}





\section{Affine morphisms}
\label{section-affine}

\noindent
We have already defined in Section \ref{section-representable}
what it means for a representable morphism of algebraic spaces
to be affine.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-affine-representable}
Let $S$ be a scheme. Let $f : X \to Y$ be a representable
morphism of algebraic spaces over $S$. Then
$f$ is affine if and only if for all affine schemes $Z$
and morphisms $Z \to Y$ the scheme $X \times_Y Z$ is affine.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
This follows directly from the definition of an affine morphism of schemes
(Morphisms, Definition \ref{morphisms-definition-affine}).
\end{proof}

\noindent
This clears the way for the following definition.

\begin{definition}
\label{definition-affine}
Let $S$ be a scheme.
Let $f : X \to Y$ be a morphism of algebraic spaces over $S$.
We say $f$ is {\it affine} if for every affine scheme $Z$ and
morphism $Z \to Y$ the algebraic space $X \times_Y Z$ is representable
by an affine scheme.
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-affine-local}
Let $S$ be a scheme.
Let $f : X \to Y$ be a morphism of algebraic spaces over $S$.
The following are equivalent:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $f$ is representable and affine,
\item $f$ is affine,
\item there exists a scheme $V$ and a surjective etale morphism
$V \to Y$ such that $V \times_Y X \to V$ is affine, and
\item there exists a Zariski covering $Y = \bigcup Y_i$ such
that each of the morphisms $f^{-1}(Y_i) \to Y_i$ is affine.
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
It is clear that (1) implies (2) and that (2) implies (3) by taking
$V$ to be a disjoint union of affines etale over $Y$, see
Properties of Spaces,
Lemma \ref{spaces-properties-lemma-cover-by-union-affines}.
Assume $V \to Y$ is as in (3). Then for every affine open $W$ of $V$ we see
that $W \times_Y X$ is an affine open of $V \times_Y X$. Hence by
Properties of Spaces, Lemma \ref{spaces-properties-lemma-subscheme}
we conclude that $V \times_Y X$ is a scheme. Moreover the morphism
$V \times_Y X \to V$ is affine. This means we can apply
Spaces,
Lemma \ref{spaces-lemma-morphism-sheaves-with-P-effective-descent-etale}
because the class of affine morphisms satisfies all the required
properties (see
Morphisms, Lemmas \ref{morphisms-lemma-base-change-affine} and
Descent, Lemmas \ref{descent-lemma-descending-property-affine}
and \ref{descent-lemma-affine}). The conclusion of applying this lemma
is that $f$ is representable and affine, i.e., (1) holds.

\medskip\noindent
The equivalence of (1) and (4) follows from the fact that being
affine is Zariski local on the target (the reference above shows
that being affine is in fact fpqc local on the target).

The composition of affine morphisms is affine.

\section{Quasi-affine morphisms}
\label{section-quasi-affine}

\noindent
We have already defined in Section \ref{section-representable}
what it means for a representable morphism of algebraic spaces
to be quasi-affine.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-quasi-affine-representable}
Let $S$ be a scheme. Let $f : X \to Y$ be a representable
morphism of algebraic spaces over $S$. Then
$f$ is quasi-affine if and only if for all affine schemes $Z$
and morphisms $Z \to Y$ the scheme $X \times_Y Z$ is quasi-affine.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
This follows directly from the definition of a quasi-affine morphism
of schemes
(Morphisms, Definition \ref{morphisms-definition-quasi-affine}).
\end{proof}

\noindent
This clears the way for the following definition.

\begin{definition}
\label{definition-quasi-affine}
Let $S$ be a scheme.
Let $f : X \to Y$ be a morphism of algebraic spaces over $S$.
We say $f$ is {\it quasi-affine} if for every affine scheme $Z$ and
morphism $Z \to Y$ the algebraic space $X \times_Y Z$ is representable
by a quasi-affine scheme.
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-quasi-affine-local}
Let $S$ be a scheme.
Let $f : X \to Y$ be a morphism of algebraic spaces over $S$.
The following are equivalent:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $f$ is representable and quasi-affine,
\item $f$ is quasi-affine,
\item there exists a scheme $V$ and a surjective etale morphism
$V \to Y$ such that $V \times_Y X \to V$ is quasi-affine, and
\item there exists a Zariski covering $Y = \bigcup Y_i$ such
that each of the morphisms $f^{-1}(Y_i) \to Y_i$ is quasi-affine.
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
It is clear that (1) implies (2) and that (2) implies (3) by taking
$V$ to be a disjoint union of affines etale over $Y$, see
Properties of Spaces,
Lemma \ref{spaces-properties-lemma-cover-by-union-affines}.
Assume $V \to Y$ is as in (3). Then for every affine open $W$ of $V$ we see
that $W \times_Y X$ is a quasi-affine open of $V \times_Y X$. Hence by
Properties of Spaces, Lemma \ref{spaces-properties-lemma-subscheme}
we conclude that $V \times_Y X$ is a scheme. Moreover the morphism
$V \times_Y X \to V$ is quasi-affine. This means we can apply
Spaces,
Lemma \ref{spaces-lemma-morphism-sheaves-with-P-effective-descent-etale}
because the class of quasi-affine morphisms satisfies all the required
properties (see
Morphisms, Lemmas \ref{morphisms-lemma-base-change-quasi-affine} and
Descent, Lemmas \ref{descent-lemma-descending-property-quasi-affine}
and \ref{descent-lemma-quasi-affine}). The conclusion of applying this lemma
is that $f$ is representable and quasi-affine, i.e., (1) holds.

\medskip\noindent
The equivalence of (1) and (4) follows from the fact that being
quasi-affine is Zariski local on the target (the reference above shows
that being quasi-affine is in fact fpqc local on the target).

\section{Types of morphisms local on source and target}
\label{section-local-source-target}

\noindent
Given a property of morphisms of schemes which is local on the source
and the target in the etale topology we may use it to define a corresponding
property of morphisms of algebraic spaces, namely by imposing either of
the equivalent conditions of the lemma below. (We will not always
automatically do so; so in each instance we will explicitly restate
the definition elsewhere.)

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-local-source-target}
Let $S$ be a scheme.
Let $f : X \to Y$ be a morphism of algebraic spaces over $S$.
Let $\mathcal{P}$ be a property of morphisms of schemes
which is etale local on the source and the target, see
Descent, Definitions \ref{descent-definition-property-morphisms-local} and
\ref{descent-definition-property-morphisms-local-source}.
Consider commutative diagrams
$$
\xymatrix{
U \ar[d] \ar[r]_\psi & V \ar[d] \\
X \ar[r]^f & Y
}
$$
where $U$ and $V$ are schemes and the vertical arrows are etale.
The following are equivalent
\begin{enumerate}
\item for any diagram as above the morphism $\psi$ has property
$\mathcal{P}$, and
\item for some diagram as above with surjective vertical arrows
the morphism $\psi$ has property $\mathcal{P}$.
\end{enumerate}
If $X$ and $Y$ are representable, then this is also
equivalent to $f$ (as a morphisms of schemes) having property $\mathcal{P}$.
If $\mathcal{P}$ is also preserved under any base change, and
fppf local on the base, then for representable morphisms $f$ this
is also equivalent to $f$ having property $\mathcal{P}$ in the sense
of Section \ref{section-representable}.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Omitted. Hint: This requires drawing a bunch of commutative diagrams
and arguing formally.
\end{proof}







\section{Morphisms of finite type}
\label{section-finite-type}

\noindent
For a morphism of schemes the property of being locally of finite type is
stable under base change and fpqc local on
the target and fppf local on the source. See
Morphisms, Lemma \ref{morphisms-lemma-base-change-finite-type}, and
Descent, Lemmas \ref{descent-lemma-descending-property-finite-type} and
\ref{descent-lemma-locally-finite-type-fppf-local-source}.
Hence, by
Lemma \ref{lemma-local-source-target}
above, we may define what it means for a morphism of algebraic spaces
to be locally of finite type as
follows and it agrees with the already existing notion defined in
Section \ref{section-representable}
when the morphism is representable.

\begin{definition}
\label{definition-locally-finite-type}
Let $S$ be a scheme.
\begin{enumerate}
\item A morphism of algebraic spaces $f : X \to Y$ is
{\it locally of finite type} if the equivalent conditions of
Lemma \ref{lemma-local-source-target} hold with
$\mathcal{P} = \text{locally of finite type}$.
\item A morphism of  algebraic spaces $f : X \to Y$ is
{\it of finite type} if it is locally of finite type and quasi-compact.
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

\noindent
Consider the algebraic space $[\mathbf{A}^1_k/\mathbf{Z}]$ of
Spaces, Example \ref{spaces-example-affine-line-translation}.
The morphism $[\mathbf{A}^1_k/\mathbf{Z}] \to \text{Spec}(k)$
is of finite type.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-composition-finite-type}
The composition of finite type morphisms is of finite type.
The same holds for locally of finite type.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Omitted.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-base-change-finite-type}
A base change of a finite type morphism is finite type.
The same holds for locally of finite type.

\begin{proof}
Omitted.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-finite-type-local}
Let $S$ be a scheme.
Let $f : X \to Y$ be a morphism of algebraic spaces over $S$.
The following are equivalent:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $f$ is locally of finite type,
\item for every scheme $Z$ and any morphism $Z \to Y$ the morphism
$Z \times_Y X \to Z$ is locally of finite type,
\item for every affine scheme $Z$ and any morphism
$Z \to Y$ the morphism $Z \times_Y X \to Z$ is locally of finite type,
\item there exists a scheme $V$ and a surjective etale morphism
$V \to Y$ such that $V \times_Y X \to V$ is locally of finite type,
\item there exists a scheme $U$ and a surjective etale morphism
$\varphi : U \to X$ such that the composition $f \circ \varphi$
is locally of finite type,
\item for every commutative diagram
$$
\xymatrix{
U \ar[d] \ar[r] & V \ar[d] \\
X \ar[r] & Y

$$
where $U$, $V$ are schemes and the vertical arrows are etale
the top horizontal arrow is locally of finite type,
\item there exists a commutative diagram
$$
\xymatrix{
U \ar[d] \ar[r] & V \ar[d] \\
X \ar[r] & Y

$$
where $U$, $V$ are schemes and the vertical arrows are surjective etale
such that the top horizontal arrow is locally of finite type, and
\item there exist Zariski coverings $Y = \bigcup_{i \in I} Y_i$,
and $f^{-1}(Y_i) = \bigcup X_{ij}$ such that
each morphism $X_{ij} \to Y_i$ is locally of finite type.
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Omitted.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-permanence-finite-type}
Let $S$ be a scheme.
Let $f : X \to Y$, $g : Y \to Z$ be morphisms of algebraic spaces over $S$.
If $g \circ f : X \to Z$ is locally of finite type, then $f : X \to Y$
is locally of finite type.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
We can find a diagram
$$
\xymatrix{
U \ar[r] \ar[d] & V \ar[r] \ar[d] & W \ar[d] \\
X \ar[r] & Y \ar[r] & Z
}
$$
where $U$, $V$, $W$ are schemes, the vertical arrows are etale and surjective,
see
Spaces, Lemma \ref{spaces-lemma-lift-morphism-presentations}.
At this point we can use
Lemma \ref{lemma-finite-type-local}
and
Morphisms, Lemma \ref{morphisms-lemma-permanence-finite-type}
to conclude.

\section{Points and geometric points}
\label{section-points-fields}

\noindent
In this section we make some remarks on points and geometric points.

\begin{definition}
\label{definition-geometric-point}
Let $S$ be a scheme. Let $X$ be an algebraic space over $S$.
A {\it geometric point} of $X$ is a morphism
$\overline{x} : \text{Spec}(k) \to X$, where $k$ is an algebraically
closed\footnote{This differs from the chapter on etale cohomology where
we used separably closed fields.} field.
\end{definition}

\noindent
For every geometric point $\overline{x}$ we have the corresponding
``image'' point $x \in |X|$. We sometimes refer to this situation by saying
that $\overline{x}$ is a {\it geometric point lying over $x$}. We also
often abuse notation and write $\overline{x} = \text{Spec}(k)$.

\medskip\noindent
Another way to think about a geometric point of $X$ is to assume
given a geometric point $\overline{s} : \text{Spec}(k) \to S$ of $S$
and a lift of $\overline{s}$ to a morphism $\overline{x}$ into $X$.
Here is a diagram
$$
\xymatrix{
\text{Spec}(k) \ar[r]_-{\overline{x}} \ar[rd]_{\overline{s}} & X \ar[d] \\
& S.
}
$$
We often say ``let $k$ be an algebraically closed field over $S$''
to indicate that $\text{Spec}(k)$ comes equipped with a morphism
$\text{Spec}(k) \to S$. In this situation we write
$$
X(k) = \text{Mor}_S(\text{Spec}(k), X) =
\{\overline{x} \in X\text{ lying over }\overline{s}\}
$$
for the set of $k$-valued points of $X$. In this case the map
$X(k) \to |X|$ maps into the subset $|X_s| \subset |X|$.
Here $X_s = \text{Spec}(\kappa(s)) \times_S X$, where $s \in S$
is the point corresponding to $\overline{s}$. As
$\text{Spec}(\kappa(s)) \to S$ is a monomorphism, also the base change
$X_s \to X$ is a monomorphism, and $|X_s|$ is indeed a subset of $|X|$.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-locally-finite-type-surjective-geometric-points}
Let $S$ be a scheme. Let $f : X \to Y$ be a morphism of algebraic spaces
over $S$. Assume $f$ is locally of finite type. The following are equivalent:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $f$ is surjective, and
\item for every algebraically closed field $k$ over $S$ the induced
map $X(k) \to Y(k)$ is surjective.
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Choose a diagram
$$
\xymatrix{
U \ar[d] \ar[r] & V \ar[d] \\
X \ar[r] & Y
}
$$
with $U$, $V$ schemes over $S$ and vertical arrows surjective
and etale, see
Spaces, Lemma \ref{spaces-lemma-lift-morphism-presentations}.
Since $f$ is locally of finite type we see that $U \to V$ is locally of
finite type.

\medskip\noindent
Assume (1) and let $\overline{y} \in Y(k)$. Then $U \to Y$ is
surjective and locally of finite type by
Lemmas \ref{lemma-composition-surjective} and
\ref{lemma-composition-finite-type}.
Let $Z = U \times_{Y, \overline{y}} \text{Spec}(k)$. This is a scheme.
The projection $Z \to \text{Spec}(k)$
is surjective and locally of finite type by
Lemmas \ref{lemma-base-change-surjective} and
\ref{lemma-base-change-finite-type}.
It follows from
Varieties, Lemma \ref{varieties-lemma-locally-finite-type-Jacobson}
that $Z$ has a $k$ valued point $\overline{z}$. The image
$\overline{x} \in X(k)$ of $\overline{z}$ maps to $\overline{y}$
as desired.

\medskip\noindent
Assume (2). By
Properties of Spaces,
Lemma \ref{spaces-properties-lemma-characterize-surjective}
it suffices to show that $|X| \to |Y|$ is surjective.
Let $y \in |Y|$. Choose a $u \in U$ mapping to $y$.
Let $k \supset \kappa(u)$ be an algebraic closure. Denote
$\overline{u} \in U(k)$ the corresponding point and
$\overline{y} \in Y(k)$ its image. By assumption there exists
a $\overline{x} \in X(k)$ mapping to $\overline{y}$.
Then it is clear that the image $x \in |X|$ of $\overline{x}$
maps to $y$.
\end{proof}

\noindent
In order to state the next lemma we introduce the following
notation. Given a scheme $T$ we denote
$$
\lambda(T) = \sup\{\aleph_0, |\kappa(t)| ; t \in T\}.
$$
In words $\lambda(T)$ is the smallest infinite cardinal bounding
all the cardinalities of residue fields ot $T$. Note that if $R$
is a ring then the cardinality of any residue field $\kappa(\mathfrak p)$
of $R$ is bounded by the cardinality of $R$ (details omitted).
This implies that $\lambda(T) \leq \text{size}(T)$ where
$\text{size}(T)$ is the size of the scheme $T$ as introduced in
Sets, Section \ref{sets-section-categories-schemes}.
If $K \subset L$ is a finitely generated field extension then
$|K| \leq |L| \leq \max\{\aleph_0, |K|\}$. It follows that if $T' \to T$
is a morphism of schemes which is locally of finite
type then $\lambda(T') \leq \lambda(T)$, and if $T' \to T$ is also
surjective then equality holds. Next, suppose that $S$ is a scheme
and that $X$ is an algebraic space over $S$. In this case we define
$$
\lambda(X) := \lambda(U)
$$
where $U$ is any scheme over $S$ which has a surjective etale morphism
towards $X$. The reason that this is independent of the choice of $U$
is that given a pair of such schemes $U$ and $U'$ the fibre product
$U \times_X U'$ is a scheme which admits a surjective etale morphism
to both $U$ and $U'$, whence $\lambda(U) = \lambda(U \times_X U') =
\lambda(U')$ by the discussion above.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-large-enough}
Let $S$ be a scheme. Let $X$, $Y$ be algebraic spaces over $S$.
\begin{enumerate}
\item As $k$ ranges over all algebraically closed fields over $S$
the collection of geometric points $\overline{y} \in Y(k)$ cover all of $|Y|$.
\item As $k$ ranges over all algebraically closed fields over $S$ with
$|k| \geq \lambda(Y)$ and $|k| > \lambda(X)$ the geometric points
$\overline{y} \in Y(k)$ cover all of $|Y|$.
\item For any geometric point
$\overline{s} : \text{Spec}(k) \to S$ where
$k$ has cardinality $> \lambda(X)$ the map
$$
X(k) \longrightarrow |X_s|
$$
is surjective.
\item Let $X \to Y$ be a morphism of algebraic spaces over $S$.
For any geometric point $\overline{s} : \text{Spec}(k) \to S$ where
$k$ has cardinality $> \lambda(X)$ the map
$$
X(k) \longrightarrow |X| \times_{|Y|} Y(k)
$$
is surjective.
\item Let $X \to Y$ be a morphism of algebraic spaces over $S$.
The following are equivalent:
\begin{enumerate}
\item the map $X \to Y$ is surjective,
\item for all algebraically closed fields $k$ over $S$ with
$|k| > \lambda(X)$, and $|k| \geq \lambda(Y)$ the map $X(k) \to Y(k)$
is surjective.
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
To prove part (1) choose a surjective etale morphism $V \to Y$ where
$V$ is a scheme. For each $v \in V$ choose an algebraic closure
$\kappa(v) \subset k_v$. Consider the morphisms
$\overline{x} : \text{Spec}(k_v) \to V \to Y$.
By construction of $|Y|$ these cover $|Y|$.

\medskip\noindent
To prove part (2) we will use the following two facts whose proofs we omit:
(\romannumeral1) If $K$ is a field and $\overline{K}$ is algebraic closure then
$|\overline{K}| \leq \max\{\aleph_0, |K|\}$.
(\romannumeral2) For any algebraically closed field $k$ and any cardinal
$\aleph$, $\aleph \geq |k|$ there exists an extension of algebraically
closed fields $k \subset k'$ with $|k'| = \aleph$.
Now we set $\aleph = \max\{\lambda(X), \lambda(Y)\}^+$.
Here $\lambda^+ > \lambda$ indicates the next bigger cardinal, see
Sets, Section \ref{sets-section-cardinals}.
Now (\romannumeral1)
implies that the fields $k_u$ constructed in the first paragraph
of the proof all have cardinality bounded by $\lambda(X)$. Hence 
by (\romannumeral2) we can find extensions $k_u \subset k'_u$ such that
$|k'_u| = \aleph$. The morphisms
$\overline{x}' : \text{Spec}(k'_u) \to X$ cover $|X|$ as desired.
To really finish the proof of (2) we need to show that the schemes
$\text{Spec}(k'_u)$ are (isomorphic to) objects of $\textit{Sch}_{fppf}$
because our conventions are that all schemes are objects of
$\textit{Sch}_{fppf}$; the rest of this paragraph should be skipped by
anyone who is not interested in set theoretical considerations. By
construction there exists an object $T$ of $\textit{Sch}_{fppf}$ such that
$\lambda(X)$ and $\lambda(Y)$ are bounded by $\text{size}(T)$.
By our construction of the category $\textit{Sch}_{fppf}$ in
Topologies, Definitions \ref{topologies-definition-big-fppf-site}
as the category $\textit{Sch}_\alpha$ constructed in
Sets, Lemma \ref{sets-lemma-construct-category}
we see that any scheme whose size is $\leq \text{size}(T)^+$
is isomorphic to an object of $\textit{Sch}_{fppf}$. See
the expression for the function $Bound$ in
Sets, Equation (\ref{sets-equation-bound}).
Since $\aleph \leq \text{size}(T)^+$ we conclude.

\medskip\noindent
The notation $X_s$ in part (3) means
the fibre product $\text{Spec}(\kappa(s)) \times_S X$, where $s \in S$
is the point corresponding to $\overline{s}$. Hence part (2) follows
from (4) with $Y = \text{Spec}(\kappa(s))$.

\medskip\noindent
Let us prove (4). Let $X \to Y$ be a morphism of algebraic spaces over $S$.
Let $k$ be an algebraically closed field over $S$ of cardinality
$> \lambda(X)$. Let $\overline{y} \in Y(k)$ and $x \in |X|$ which map to the
same element $y$ of $|Y|$.
We have to find $\overline{x} \in X(k)$ mapping to $x$ and $\overline{y}$.
Choose a commutative diagram
$$
\xymatrix{
U \ar[d] \ar[r] & V \ar[d] \\
X \ar[r] & Y
}
$$
with $U$, $V$ schemes over $S$ and vertical arrows surjective
and etale, see
Spaces, Lemma \ref{spaces-lemma-lift-morphism-presentations}.
Choose a $u \in |U|$ which maps to $x$, and denote $v \in |V|$ the image.
We will think of $u = \text{Spec}(\kappa(u))$ and
$v = \text{Spec}(\kappa(v))$ as schemes.
Note that $V \times_Y \text{Spec}(k)$ is a scheme etale over $k$.
Hence it is a disjoint union of spectra of finite separable
extensions of $k$, see
Morphisms, Lemma \ref{morphisms-lemma-etale-over-field}.
As $v$ maps to $y$ we see that $v \times_Y \text{Spec}(k)$ is a
nonempty scheme. As $v \to V$ is a monomorphism, we see that
$v \times_Y \text{Spec}(k) \to V \times_Y \text{Spec}(k)$
is a monomorphism. Hence $v \times_Y \text{Spec}(k)$ is a disjoint
union of spectra of finite separable extensions of $k$, by
Schemes, Lemma \ref{schemes-lemma-mono-towards-spec-field}.
We conclude that the morphism
$v \times_Y \text{Spec}(k) \to \text{Spec}(k)$
has a section, i.e., we can find a morphism
$\overline{v} : \text{Spec}(k) \to V$ lying over $v$ and over
$\overline{y}$. Finally we consider the scheme
$$
u \times_{V, \overline{v}} \text{Spec}(k)
=
\text{Spec}(\kappa(u) \otimes_{\kappa(v)} k)
$$
where $\kappa(v) \to k$ is the field map defining the morphism
$\overline{v}$. Since the cardinality of $k$ is larger than the cardinality
of $\kappa(u)$ by assumption we may apply
Algebra, Lemma \ref{algebra-lemma-base-change-Jacobson}
to see that any maximal ideal
$\mathfrak m \subset \kappa(u) \otimes_{\kappa(v)} k$
has a residue field which is algebraic over $k$ and hence equal to $k$.
Such a maximal ideal will hence produce a morphism
$\overline{u} : \text{Spec}(k) \to U$ lying over $u$ and mapping to
$\overline{v}$. The composition $\text{Spec}(k) \to U \to X$
will be the desired geometric point $\overline{x} \in X(k)$.
This concludes the proof of part (4).

\medskip\noindent
Part (5) is a formal consequence of parts (2) and (4) and
Properties of Spaces,
Lemma \ref{spaces-properties-lemma-characterize-surjective}.
\end{proof}








\section{Quasi-finite morphisms}
\label{section-quasi-finite}

\noindent
For a morphism of schemes the property of being locally quasi-finite is
stable under base change and fpqc local on
the target and etale local on the source. See
Morphisms, Lemma \ref{morphisms-lemma-base-change-quasi-finite}, and
Descent, Lemmas \ref{descent-lemma-descending-property-quasi-finite} and
\ref{descent-lemma-locally-quasi-finite-etale-local-source}.
Hence, by
Lemma \ref{lemma-local-source-target}
above, we may define what it means for a morphism of algebraic spaces
to be locally quasi-finite as
follows and it agrees with the already existing notion defined in
Section \ref{section-representable}
when the morphism is representable.

\begin{definition}
\label{definition-locally-quasi-finite}
Let $S$ be a scheme.
\begin{enumerate}
\item A morphism of algebraic spaces $f : X \to Y$ is
{\it locally quasi-finite} if the equivalent conditions of
Lemma \ref{lemma-local-source-target} hold with
$\mathcal{P} = \text{locally quasi-finite}$.
\item A morphism of  algebraic spaces $f : X \to Y$ is
{\it quasi-finite} if it is locally quasi-finite and quasi-compact.
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-composition-quasi-finite}
The composition of quasi-finite morphisms is quasi-finite.
The same holds for locally quasi-finite.

Let $S$ be a scheme.

\item $f$ is locally quasi-finite,

Let $X \to Y \to Z$ be morphisms of algebraic spaces over $S$.
If $X \to Z$ is locally quasi-finite, then $X \to Y$
is locally quasi-finite.
\end{lemma}

Choose a commutative diagram

with vertical arrows etale and surjective. (See

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-monomorphism-loc-finite-type-loc-quasi-finite}
Let $S$ be a scheme.
Let $f : X \to Y$ be a morphism of algebraic spaces over $S$.
If $f$ is locally of finite type and a monomorphism, then $f$
is separated and locally quasi-finite.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
A monomorphism is separated, see
Lemma \ref{lemma-monomorphism-separated}.
By
Lemma \ref{lemma-quasi-finite-local}
it suffices to prove the lemma after performing a base change
by $Z \to Y$ with $Z$ affine. Hence we may assume that $Y$ is an
affine scheme. Choose an affine scheme $U$ and an etale morphism
$U \to X$. Since $X \to Y$ is locally of finite type the morphism
of affine schemes $U \to Y$ is of finite type.
Since $X \to Y$ is a monomorphism we have $U \times_X U = U \times_Y U$.
In particular the maps $U \times_Y U \to U$ are etale.
Let $y \in Y$. Then either $U_y$ is empty, or
$\text{Spec}(\kappa(u)) \times_{\text{Spec}(\kappa(y))} U_y$
is isomorphic to the fibre of $U \times_Y U \to U$ over $u$ for
some $u \in U$ lying over $y$. This implies that the fibres of
$U \to Y$ are finite discrete sets (as $U \times_Y U \to U$
is an etale morphism of affine schemes, see
Morphisms, Lemma \ref{morphisms-lemma-etale-over-field}).
Hence $U \to Y$ is quasi-finite, see
Morphisms, Lemma \ref{morphisms-lemma-quasi-finite-at-point-characterize}.
As $U \to X$ was an arbitrary etale morphism with $U$ affine
this implies that $X \to Y$ is locally quasi-finite.
\end{proof}






\section{Morphisms of finite presentation}
\label{section-finite-presentation}

\noindent
For a morphism of schemes the property of being locally of finite presentation
is stable under base change and fpqc local on the target and
etale local on the source. See
Morphisms, Lemma \ref{morphisms-lemma-base-change-finite-presentation}, and
Descent,
Lemmas \ref{descent-lemma-descending-property-locally-finite-presentation}
and

Hence, by
Lemma \ref{lemma-local-source-target}
above, we may define what it means for a morphism of algebraic spaces
to be locally quasi-finite as
follows and it agrees with the already existing notion defined in
Section \ref{section-representable}
when the morphism is representable.

\begin{definition}
\label{definition-locally-finite-presentation}
Let $S$ be a scheme.
\begin{enumerate}
\item A morphism of algebraic spaces $f : X \to Y$ is
{\it locally of finite presentation} if the equivalent conditions of
Lemma \ref{lemma-local-source-target} hold with
$\mathcal{P} =$``locally of finite presentation''.
\item A morphism of  algebraic spaces $f : X \to Y$ is
{\it of finite presentation}
if it is locally of finite presentation, quasi-compact and
quasi-separated.
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

\noindent
Note that a morphism of finite presentation is {\bf not} just a quasi-compact
morphisms which is locally of finite presentation.

\begin{lemma}

The composition of morphisms of finite presentation is of finite presentation.
The same holds for locally of finite presentation.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-finite-presentation-local}
Let $S$ be a scheme.
Let $f : X \to Y$ be a morphism of algebraic spaces over $S$.
The following are equivalent:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $f$ is locally of finite presentation,
\item for every scheme $Z$ and any morphism $Z \to Y$ the morphism
$Z \times_Y X \to Z$ is locally of finite presentation,

locally of finite presentation,
\item there exists a scheme $U$ and a surjective etale morphism
$\varphi : U \to X$ such that the composition $f \circ \varphi$
is locally of finite presentation,
\item for every commutative diagram
$$
\xymatrix{
U \ar[d] \ar[r] & V \ar[d] \\
X \ar[r] & Y

where $U$, $V$ are schemes and the vertical arrows are etale
the top horizontal arrow is locally of finite presentation,

\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}

\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-finite-presentation-finite-type}
A morphism which is locally of finite presentation is locally of finite type.
A morphism of finite presentation is of finite type.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Let $f : X \to Y$ be a morphism of algebraic spaces which is locally of
finite presentation. This means there exists a diagram as in
Lemma \ref{lemma-local-source-target}
with $\psi$ locally of finite presentation and surjective vertical arrows. By
Morphisms, Lemma \ref{morphisms-lemma-finite-presentation-finite-type}
$\psi$ is locally of finite presentation.
Hence $X \to Y$ is locally of finite type by definition.
If $f$ is of finite presentation then it is quasi-compact and
it follows that $f$ is of finite type.
\end{proof}










\section{Open morphisms}
\label{section-open}

\noindent
For a representable morphism of algebraic spaces we have already defined (in
Section \ref{section-representable})
what it means to be universally open. Hence before we give the natural
definition we check that it agrees with this in the representable case.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-characterize-representable-universally-open}
Let $S$ be a scheme. Let $f : X \to Y$ be a representable morphism of
algebraic spaces over $S$. The following are equivalent
\begin{enumerate}
\item $f$ is universally open, and
\item for every morphism of algebraic spaces $Z \to Y$ the morphism of
topological spaces $|Z \times_Y X| \to |Z|$ is open.
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Assume (1), and let $Z \to Y$ be as in (2). Choose a scheme $V$ and
a surjective etale morphism $V \to Y$. By assumption the morphism
of schemes $V \times_Y X \to V$ is universally open. By
Properties of Spaces, Section \ref{spaces-properties-section-points}
in the commutative diagram
$$
\xymatrix{
|V \times_Y X| \ar[r] \ar[d] & |Z \times_Y X| \ar[d] \\
|V| \ar[r] & |Z|
}
$$
the horizontal arrows are open and surjective, and moreover
$$
|V \times_Y X| \longrightarrow |V| \times_{|Z|} |Z \times_Y X|
$$
is surjective. Hence as the left
vertical arrow is open it follows that the right vertical arrow is
open. This proves (2). The implication (2) $\Rightarrow$ (1) is
immediate from the definitions.
\end{proof}

\noindent
Thus we may use the following natural definition.

\begin{definition}
\label{definition-open}
Let $S$ be a scheme. Let $f : X \to Y$ be a morphism of algebraic spaces
over $S$.
\begin{enumerate}
\item We say $f$ is {\it open} if the map of topological spaces
$|f| : |X| \to |Y|$ is open.
\item We say $f$ is {\it universally open} if for every morphism
of algebraic spaces $Z \to Y$ the morphism of topological spaces
$$
|Z \times_Y X| \to |Z|
$$
is open, i.e., the base change $Z \times_Y X \to Z$ is open.
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-base-change-universally-open}
The base change of a universally open morphism of algebraic spaces
by any morphism of algebraic spaces is universally open.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
This is immediate from the definition.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-composition-universally-open}
The composition of a pair of (universally) open morphisms of algebraic spaces
is (universally) open.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Omitted.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-universally-open-local}
Let $S$ be a scheme. Let $f : X \to Y$ be a morphism of algebraic spaces
over $S$. The following are equivalent
\begin{enumerate}
\item $f$ is universally open,
\item for every scheme $Z$ and every morphism $Z \to Y$
the projection $|Z \times_Y X| \to |Z|$ is open,
\item for every affine scheme $Z$ and every morphism $Z \to Y$
the projection $|Z \times_Y X| \to |Z|$ is open, and
\item there exists a scheme $V$ and a surjective etale morphism
$V \to Y$ such that $V \times_Y X \to V$ is a universally open morpism
of algebraic spaces, and
\item there exists a Zariski covering $Y = \bigcup Y_i$ such that
each of the morphisms $f^{-1}(Y_i) \to Y_i$ is universally open.
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
We omit the proof that (1) implies (2), and that (2) implies (3).

\medskip\noindent
Assume (3). Choose a surjective etale morphism $V \to Y$.
We are going to show that $V \times_Y X \to V$ is a universally
open morphism of algebraic spaces. Let $Z \to V$ be a morphism
from an algebraic space to $V$. Let $W \to Z$ be a surjective etale
morphism where $W = \coprod W_i$ is a disjoint union of affine schemes, see
Properties of Spaces,
Lemma \ref{spaces-properties-lemma-cover-by-union-affines}.
Then we have the following commutative diagram
$$
\xymatrix{
\coprod_i |W_i \times_Y X| \ar@{=}[r] \ar[d] &
|W \times_Y X| \ar[r] \ar[d] &
|Z \times_Y X| \ar[d] \ar@{=}[r] &
|Z \times_V (V \times_Y X)| \ar[ld] \\
\coprod |W_i| \ar@{=}[r] &
|W| \ar[r] &
|Z|
}
$$
We have to show the south-east arrow is open. The middle horizontal
arrows are surjective and open
(Properties of Spaces, Lemma \ref{spaces-properties-lemma-etale-open}).
By assumption (3), and the fact that
$W_i$ is affine we see that the left vertical arrows are open. Hence
it follows that the right vertical arrow is open.

\medskip\noindent
Assume $V \to Y$ is as in (4). We will show that $f$ is universally open.
Let $Z \to Y$ be a morphism of algebraic spaces. Consider the
diagram
$$
\xymatrix{
|(V \times_Y Z) \times_V (V \times_Y X)| \ar@{=}[r] \ar[rd] &
|V \times_Y X| \ar[r] \ar[d] &
|Z \times_Y X| \ar[d] \\
 &
|V \times_Y Z| \ar[r] &
|Z|
}
$$
The south-west arrow is open by assumption. The horizontal arrows are
surjective and open because the corresponding morphisms of
algebraic spaces are etale (see
Properties of spaces, Lemma \ref{spaces-properties-lemma-etale-open}).
It follows that the right vertical arrow is open.

\medskip\noindent
Of course (1) implies (5) by taking the covering $Y = Y$.
Assume $Y = \bigcup Y_i$ is as in (5). Then for any $Z \to Y$
we get a corresponding Zariski covering $Z = \bigcup Z_i$ such that
the base change of $f$ to $Z_i$ is open. By a simple topological
argument this implies that $Z \times_Y X \to Z$ is open. Hence (1) holds.
\end{proof}






\section{Submersive morphisms}
\label{section-submersive}

\begin{definition}
\label{definition-submersive}
Let $S$ be a scheme.
Let $f : X \to Y$ be a morphism of algebraic spaces over $S$.
\begin{enumerate}
\item We say $f$ is {\it submersive}\footnote{This is very different
from the notion of a submersion of differential manifolds.}
if the continuous map $|X| \to |Y|$ is submersive, see
Topology, Definition \ref{topology-definition-submersive}.
\item We say $f$ is {\it universally submersive} if for every
morphism of algebraic spaces $Y' \to Y$ the base change
$Y' \times_Y X \to Y'$ is submersive.
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

\noindent
We note that a submersive morphism is in particular surjective.








\section{Flat morphisms}
\label{section-flat}

\noindent
For a morphism of schemes the property of being flat is
stable under base change and fpqc local on
both the target and the source. See
Morphisms, Lemma \ref{morphisms-lemma-base-change-flat}, and
Descent, Lemmas \ref{descent-lemma-descending-property-flat} and
\ref{descent-lemma-flat-fpqc-local-source}.
Hence, by
Lemma \ref{lemma-local-source-target}
above, we may define the notion of a flat morphism of algebraic spaces as
follows and it agrees with the already existing notion defined in
Section \ref{section-representable}
when the morphism is representable.

\begin{definition}
\label{definition-flat}
Let $S$ be a scheme.
A morphism of algebraic spaces $f : X \to Y$ is {\it flat} if
the equivalent conditions of Lemma \ref{lemma-local-source-target} hold with
$\mathcal{P} = \text{flat}$.

The composition of flat morphisms is flat.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-flat-local}
Let $S$ be a scheme.
Let $f : X \to Y$ be a morphism of algebraic spaces over $S$.
The following are equivalent:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $f$ is flat,
\item for every scheme $Z$ and any morphism $Z \to Y$ the morphism
$Z \times_Y X \to Z$ is flat,
\item for every affine scheme $Z$ and any morphism
$Z \to Y$ the morphism $Z \times_Y X \to Z$ is flat,
\item there exists a scheme $V$ and a surjective etale morphism
$V \to Y$ such that $V \times_Y X \to V$ is flat,
\item there exists a scheme $U$ and a surjective etale morphism
$\varphi : U \to X$ such that the composition $f \circ \varphi$
is flat,
\item for every commutative diagram
$$
\xymatrix{
U \ar[d] \ar[r] & V \ar[d] \\
X \ar[r] & Y
}
$$
where $U$, $V$ are schemes and the vertical arrows are etale
the top horizontal arrow is flat,
\item there exists a commutative diagram
$$
\xymatrix{
U \ar[d] \ar[r] & V \ar[d] \\
X \ar[r] & Y
}
$$
where $U$, $V$ are schemes and the vertical arrows are surjective etale
such that the top horizontal arrow is flat, and
\item there exists a Zariski coverings $Y = \bigcup Y_i$ and
$f^{-1}(Y_i) = \bigcup X_{ij}$ such that
each morphism $X_{ij} \to Y_i$ is flat.
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Omitted.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-fppf-open}
A flat morphism locally of finite presentation is universally open.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Let $f : X \to Y$ be a flat morphism locally of finite presentation
of algebraic spaces over $S$. Choose a diagram
$$
\xymatrix{
U \ar[r]_\alpha \ar[d] & V \ar[d] \\
X \ar[r] & Y
}
$$
where $U$ and $V$ are schemes and the vertical arrows are surjective and
etale, see
Spaces, Lemma \ref{spaces-lemma-lift-morphism-presentations}.
By
Lemmas \ref{lemma-flat-local} and \ref{lemma-finite-presentation-local}
the morphism $\alpha$ is flat and locally of finite presentation.
Hence by
Morphisms, Lemma \ref{lemma-fppf-open}
we see that $\alpha$ is universally open.
Hence $X \to Y$ is universally open according to
Lemma \ref{lemma-universally-open-local}.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-fpqc-quotient-topology}
Let $S$ be a scheme.
Let $f : X \to Y$ be a flat, quasi-compact, surjective morphism of
algebraic spaces over $S$.
A subset $T \subset |Y|$ is open (resp.\ closed) if and only
$f^{-1}(|T|)$ is open (resp.\ closed) in $|X|$.
In other words $f$ is submersive, and in fact universally submersive.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Choose affine schemes $V_i$ and etale morphisms $V_i \to Y$ such that
$V = \coprod V_i \to Y$ is surjective, see
Properties of Spaces,
Lemma \ref{spaces-properties-lemma-cover-by-union-affines}.
For each $i$ the algebraic space $V_i \times_Y X$ is quasi-compact.
Hence we can find an affine scheme $U_i$ and a surjective etale morphism
$U_i \to V_i \times_Y X$, see
Properties of Spaces,
Lemma \ref{spaces-properties-lemma-quasi-compact-affine-cover}.
Then the composition $U_i \to V_i \times_Y X \to V_i$ is a surjective,
flat morphism of affines.
Of course then $U = \coprod U_i \to X$ is surjective and etale
and $U = V \times_Y X$. Moreover, the morphism $U \to V$ is the
disjoint union of the morphisms $U_i \to V_i$. Hence $U \to V$ is surjective,
quasi-compact and flat. Consider the diagram
$$
\xymatrix{
U \ar[r] \ar[d] & X \ar[d] \\
V \ar[r] & Y
}
$$
By definition of the topology on $|Y|$ the set $T$ is closed
(resp.\ open) if and only if $g^{-1}(T) \subset |V|$ is closed
(resp.\ open). The same holds for
$f^{-1}(T)$ and its inverse image in $|U|$.
Since $U \to V$ is quasi-compact, surjective,  and flat we win by
Morphisms, Lemma \ref{morphisms-lemma-fpqc-quotient-topology}.
\end{proof}






\section{Syntomic morphisms}
\label{section-syntomic}

For a morphism of schemes the property of being smooth is

fpqc local on the target
(Descent, Lemma \ref{descent-lemma-descending-property-smooth}),

\section{Unramified morphisms}
\label{section-unramified}

\noindent
For a morphism of schemes the property of being unramified is
stable under base change
(Morphisms, Lemma \ref{morphisms-lemma-base-change-unramified}),
fpqc local on the target
(Descent, Lemma \ref{descent-lemma-descending-property-unramified}),
and etale local on the source
(Descent, Lemma \ref{descent-lemma-unramified-etale-local-source}).
Hence, by
Lemma \ref{lemma-local-source-target}
above, we may define the notion of an unramified morphism of algebraic spaces
as follows and it agrees with the already existing notion defined in
Section \ref{section-representable}
when the morphism is representable.

\begin{definition}
\label{definition-unramified}
Let $S$ be a scheme.
A morphism of algebraic spaces $f : X \to Y$ is {\it unramified} if
the equivalent conditions of Lemma \ref{lemma-local-source-target} hold with
$\mathcal{P} = \text{unramified}$.
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-composition-unramified}
The composition of unramified morphisms is unramified.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Omitted.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-base-change-unramified}
The base change of an unramified morphism is unramified.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Omitted.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-unramified-local}
Let $S$ be a scheme.
Let $f : X \to Y$ be a morphism of algebraic spaces over $S$.
The following are equivalent:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $f$ is unramified,
\item for every scheme $Z$ and any morphism $Z \to Y$ the morphism
$Z \times_Y X \to Z$ is unramified,
\item for every affine scheme $Z$ and any morphism
$Z \to Y$ the morphism $Z \times_Y X \to Z$ is unramified,
\item there exists a scheme $V$ and a surjective etale morphism
$V \to Y$ such that $V \times_Y X \to V$ is an unramified morphism,
\item there exists a scheme $U$ and a surjective etale morphism
$\varphi : U \to X$ such that the composition $f \circ \varphi$
is unramified,
\item for every commutative diagram
$$
\xymatrix{
U \ar[d] \ar[r] & V \ar[d] \\
X \ar[r] & Y
}
$$
where $U$, $V$ are schemes and the vertical arrows are etale
the top horizontal arrow is unramified,
\item there exists a commutative diagram
$$
\xymatrix{
U \ar[d] \ar[r] & V \ar[d] \\
X \ar[r] & Y
}
$$
where $U$, $V$ are schemes and the vertical arrows are surjective etale
such that the top horizontal arrow is unramified, and
\item there exist Zariski coverings $Y = \bigcup_{i \in I} Y_i$,
and $f^{-1}(Y_i) = \bigcup X_{ij}$ such that
each morphism $X_{ij} \to Y_i$ is unramified.
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Omitted.

\section{Etale morphisms}
\label{section-etale}

\noindent
The notion of an etale morphism of algebraic spaces was defined in
Properties of Spaces, Definition \ref{spaces-properties-definition-etale}.
In this section we work out some of its properties.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-etale-local}
Let $S$ be a scheme.
Let $f : X \to Y$ be a morphism of algebraic spaces over $S$.
The following are equivalent:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $f$ is etale,
\item for every scheme $Z$ and any morphism $Z \to Y$ the morphism
$Z \times_Y X \to Z$ is etale,
\item for every affine scheme $Z$ and any morphism
$Z \to Y$ the morphism $Z \times_Y X \to Z$ is etale,
\item there exists a scheme $V$ and a surjective etale morphism
$V \to Y$ such that $V \times_Y X \to V$ is an etale morphism,
\item there exists a scheme $U$ and a surjective etale morphism
$\varphi : U \to X$ such that the composition $f \circ \varphi$
is etale,
\item for every commutative diagram
$$
\xymatrix{
U \ar[d] \ar[r] & V \ar[d] \\
X \ar[r] & Y
}
$$
where $U$, $V$ are schemes and the vertical arrows are etale
the top horizontal arrow is etale,
\item there exists a commutative diagram
$$
\xymatrix{
U \ar[d] \ar[r] & V \ar[d] \\
X \ar[r] & Y
}
$$
where $U$, $V$ are schemes and the vertical arrows are surjective etale
such that the top horizontal arrow is etale, and
\item there exist Zariski coverings $Y = \bigcup Y_i$ and
$f^{-1}(Y_i) = \bigcup X_{ij}$ such that each morphism
$X_{ij} \to Y_i$ is etale.
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Combine
Properties of Spaces, Lemmas
\ref{spaces-properties-lemma-etale-local},
\ref{spaces-properties-lemma-base-change-etale} and
\ref{spaces-properties-lemma-composition-etale}.
Some details omitted.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-composition-etale}
The composition of two etale morphisms of algebraic spaces
is etale.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
This is a copy of
Properties of Spaces, Lemma \ref{spaces-properties-lemma-composition-etale}.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-base-change-etale}
The base change of an etale morphism of algebraic spaces
by any morphism of algebraic spaces is etale.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
This is a copy of
Properties of Spaces, Lemma \ref{spaces-properties-lemma-base-change-etale}.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-etale-locally-quasi-finite}
An etale morphism of algebraic spaces is locally quasi-finite.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Let $X \to Y$ be an etale morphism of algebraic spaces, see
Properties of Spaces, Definition \ref{spaces-properties-definition-etale}.
By
Properties of Spaces, Lemma \ref{spaces-properties-lemma-etale-local}
we see this means there exists a diagram as in
Lemma \ref{lemma-local-source-target}
with $\psi$ etale and surjective vertical arrows. By
Morphisms, Lemma \ref{morphisms-lemma-etale-locally-quasi-finite}
$\psi$ is locally quasi-finite. Hence $X \to Y$ is locally quasi-finite
by definition.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-etale-flat}
An etale morphism of algebraic spaces is flat.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
The proof is identical to the proof of
Lemma \ref{lemma-etale-locally-quasi-finite}.
It uses
Morphisms, Lemma \ref{morphisms-lemma-etale-flat}.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-etale-locally-finite-presentation}
An etale morphism of algebraic spaces is locally of finite presentation.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
The proof is identical to the proof of
Lemma \ref{lemma-etale-locally-quasi-finite}.
It uses
Morphisms, Lemma \ref{morphisms-lemma-etale-locally-finite-presentation}.
\end{proof}





\section{Proper morphisms}
\label{section-proper}

\noindent
The notion of a proper morphism plays an important role in algebraic geometry.

\begin{definition}
\label{definition-proper}
Let $S$ be a scheme.
Let $f : X \to Y$ be a morphism of algebraic spaces over $S$.
We say $f$ is {\it proper} if $f$ is separated, finite type, and
universally closed.
\end{definition}








\section{Integral and finite morphisms}
\label{section-integral}

\noindent
We have already defined in Section \ref{section-representable}
what it means for a representable morphism of algebraic spaces
to be integral (resp.\ finite).

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-integral-representable}
Let $S$ be a scheme. Let $f : X \to Y$ be a representable
morphism of algebraic spaces over $S$. Then
$f$ is integral (resp.\ finite) if and only if for all affine schemes $Z$
and morphisms $Z \to Y$ the scheme $X \times_Y Z$ is affine and
integral (resp.\ finite) over $Z$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
This follows directly from the definition of an integral (resp.\ finite)
morphism of schemes
(Morphisms, Definition \ref{morphisms-definition-integral}).
\end{proof}

\noindent
This clears the way for the following definition.

\begin{definition}
\label{definition-integral}
Let $S$ be a scheme.
Let $f : X \to Y$ be a morphism of algebraic spaces over $S$.
\begin{enumerate}
\item We say that $f$ is {\it integral} if for every affine scheme $Z$
and morphisms $Z \to Y$ the algebraic space $X \times_Y Z$ is
representable by an affine scheme integral over $Z$.
\item We say that $f$ is {\it finite} if for every affine scheme $Z$
and morphisms $Z \to Y$ the algebraic space $X \times_Y Z$ is
representable by an affine scheme finite over $Z$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-integral-local}
Let $S$ be a scheme.
Let $f : X \to Y$ be a morphism of algebraic spaces over $S$.
The following are equivalent:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $f$ is representable and integral (resp.\ finite),
\item $f$ is integral (resp.\ finite),
\item there exists a scheme $V$ and a surjective etale morphism
$V \to Y$ such that $V \times_Y X \to V$ is integral (resp. finite), and
\item there exists a Zariski covering $Y = \bigcup Y_i$ such that
each of the morphisms $f^{-1}(Y_i) \to Y_i$ is integral (resp.\ finite).
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
It is clear that (1) implies (2) and that (2) implies (3) by taking
$V$ to be a disjoint union of affines etale over $Y$, see
Properties of Spaces,
Lemma \ref{spaces-properties-lemma-cover-by-union-affines}.
Assume $V \to Y$ is as in (3). Then for every affine open $W$ of $V$ we see
that $W \times_Y X$ is an affine open of $V \times_Y X$. Hence by
Properties of Spaces, Lemma \ref{spaces-properties-lemma-subscheme}
we conclude that $V \times_Y X$ is a scheme. Moreover the morphism
$V \times_Y X \to V$ is affine. This means we can apply
Spaces,
Lemma \ref{spaces-lemma-morphism-sheaves-with-P-effective-descent-etale}
because the class of integral (resp.\ finite) morphisms
satisfies all the required properties (see
Morphisms, Lemmas \ref{morphisms-lemma-base-change-finite} and
Descent, Lemmas
\ref{descent-lemma-descending-property-integral},
\ref{descent-lemma-descending-property-finite},
and \ref{descent-lemma-affine}).
The conclusion of applying this lemma is that $f$ is representable
and integral (resp.\ finite), i.e., (1) holds.

\medskip\noindent
The equivalence of (1) and (4) follows from the fact that being
integral (resp.\ finite) is Zariski local on the target (the
reference above shows that being integral or finite is in fact
fpqc local on the target).
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-composition-integral}
The composition of integral (resp.\ finite) morphisms is integral
(resp.\ finite).
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Omitted.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-base-change-integral}
The base change of an integral (resp.\ finite) morphism is integral
(resp.\ finite).
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Omitted.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-finite-integral}
A finite morphism is integral.
An integral morphism which is locally of finite type is finite.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
In both cases the morphism is representable, and you can check the condition
after a base change by an affine scheme mapping into $Y$, see
Lemmas \ref{lemma-integral-local}. Hence this lemma follows from the
same lemma for the case of schemes, see
Morphisms, Lemma \ref{morphisms-lemma-finite-integral}.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-integral-universally-closed}
Let $S$ be a scheme.
Let $f : X \to Y$ be a morphism of algebraic spaces over $S$.
The following are equivalent
\begin{enumerate}
\item $f$ is integral, and
\item $f$ is affine and universally closed.
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
In both cases the morphism is representable, and you can check the condition
after a base change by an affine scheme mapping into $Y$, see
Lemmas \ref{lemma-integral-local},
\ref{lemma-affine-local}, and
\ref{lemma-universally-closed-local}.
Hence the result follows from
Morphisms, Lemma \ref{morphisms-lemma-integral-universally-closed}.
\end{proof}






\section{Finite locally free morphisms}
\label{section-finite-locally-free}

\noindent
We have already defined in Section \ref{section-representable}
what it means for a representable morphism of algebraic spaces
to be finite locally free.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-finite-locally-free-representable}
Let $S$ be a scheme. Let $f : X \to Y$ be a representable
morphism of algebraic spaces over $S$. Then
$f$ is finite locally free if and only if $f$ is affine and
the sheaf $f_*\mathcal{O}_X$ is a finite locally free
$\mathcal{O}_Y$-module.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Assume $f$ is finite locally free (as defined in
Section \ref{section-representable}). This means that
for every morphism $V \to Y$ whose source is a scheme the
base change $f' : V \times_Y X \to V$ is a finite locally free morphism
of schemes. This in turn means (by the definition of a finite locally
free morphism of schemes) that
$f'_*\mathcal{O}_{V \times_Y X}$
is a finite locally free $\mathcal{O}_V$-module. We may choose $V \to Y$
to be surjective and etale. By
Properties of Spaces,
Lemma \ref{spaces-properties-lemma-pushforward-etale-base-change-modules}
we conclude the restriction of $f_*\mathcal{O}_X$ to $V$ is
finite locally free. Hence by
Modules on Sites, Lemma \ref{sites-modules-lemma-local-final-object}
applied to the sheaf $f_*\mathcal{O}_X$ on $Y_{spaces, etale}$
we conclude that $f_*\mathcal{O}_X$ is finite locally free.

\medskip\noindent
Conversely, assume $f$ is affine and that $f_*\mathcal{O}_X$ is a finite
locally free $\mathcal{O}_Y$-module. Let $V$ be a scheme, and let
$V \to Y$ be a surjective etale morphism. Again by
Properties of Spaces,
Lemma \ref{spaces-properties-lemma-pushforward-etale-base-change-modules}
we see that $f'_*\mathcal{O}_{V \times_Y X}$ is finite locally free.
Hence $f' : V \times_Y X \to V$ is finite locally free (as it is also affine).
By
Spaces,
Lemma \ref{spaces-lemma-morphism-sheaves-with-P-effective-descent-etale}
we conclude that $f$ is finite locally free (use
Morphisms, Lemma \ref{morphisms-lemma-base-change-finite-locally-free}
Descent, Lemmas \ref{descent-lemma-descending-property-finite-locally-free}
and \ref{descent-lemma-affine}). Thus we win.
\end{proof}

\noindent
This clears the way for the following definition.

\begin{definition}
\label{definition-finite-locally-free}
Let $S$ be a scheme.
Let $f : X \to Y$ be a morphism of algebraic spaces over $S$.
We say that $f$ is {\it finite locally free} if $f$ is affine
and $f_*\mathcal{O}_X$ is a finite locally free $\mathcal{O}_Y$-module.
In this case we say $f$ is
has {\it rank} or {\it degree} $d$
if the sheaf $f_*\mathcal{O}_X$ is finite locally free of rank $d$.
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-finite-locally-free-local}
Let $S$ be a scheme.
Let $f : X \to Y$ be a morphism of algebraic spaces over $S$.
The following are equivalent:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $f$ is representable and finite locally free,
\item $f$ is finite locally free,
\item there exists a scheme $V$ and a surjective etale morphism
$V \to Y$ such that $V \times_Y X \to V$ is finite locally free, and
\item there exists a Zariski covering $Y = \bigcup Y_i$ such that
each morphism $f^{-1}(Y_i) \to Y_i$ is finite locally free.
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
It is clear that (1) implies (2) and that (2) implies (3) by taking
$V$ to be a disjoint union of affines etale over $Y$, see
Properties of Spaces,
Lemma \ref{spaces-properties-lemma-cover-by-union-affines}.
Assume $V \to Y$ is as in (3). Then for every affine open $W$ of $V$ we see
that $W \times_Y X$ is an affine open of $V \times_Y X$. Hence by
Properties of Spaces, Lemma \ref{spaces-properties-lemma-subscheme}
we conclude that $V \times_Y X$ is a scheme. Moreover the morphism
$V \times_Y X \to V$ is affine. This means we can apply
Spaces,
Lemma \ref{spaces-lemma-morphism-sheaves-with-P-effective-descent-etale}
because the class of finite locally free morphisms
satisfies all the required properties (see
Morphisms, Lemma \ref{morphisms-lemma-base-change-finite-locally-free}
Descent, Lemmas \ref{descent-lemma-descending-property-finite-locally-free}
and \ref{descent-lemma-affine}).
The conclusion of applying this lemma is that $f$ is representable
and finite locally free, i.e., (1) holds.

\medskip\noindent
The equivalence of (1) and (4) follows from the fact that being
finite locally free is Zariski local on the target (the reference above shows
that being finite locally free is in fact fpqc local on the target).
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-composition-finite-locally-free}
The composition of finite locally free morphisms is finite locally free.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Omitted.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-base-change-finite-locally-free}
The base change of a finite locally free morphism is finite locally free.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Omitted.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-finite-flat}
Let $S$ be a scheme.
Let $f : X \to Y$ be a morphism of algebraic spaces over $S$.
The following are equivalent:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $f$ is finite locally free,
\item $f$ is finite, flat, and locally of finite presentation.
\end{enumerate}
If $Y$ is locally Noetherian these are also equivalent to
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(3)] $f$ is finite and flat.
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
In each of the three cases the morphism is representable and you
can check the property after base change by a surjective etale morphism
$V \to Y$, see
Lemmas \ref{lemma-integral-local},
\ref{lemma-finite-locally-free-local},
\ref{lemma-flat-local}, and
\ref{lemma-finite-presentation-local}.
If $Y$ is locally Noetherian, then $V$ is locally Noetherian.
Hence the result follows from the corresponding result
in the schemes case, see
Morphisms, Lemma \ref{morphisms-lemma-finite-flat}.
\end{proof}






\section{Separated, locally quasi-finite morphisms}
\label{section-schemehood}

\noindent
We prove a result that is so interesting it deserves its own section.
The result is that an algebraic space which is locally quasi-finite and
separated over a scheme is a scheme. It implies that a separated
and locally quasi-finite morphism is representable. But first...\ a lemma
(which will be obsoleted by
Proposition \ref{proposition-locally-quasi-finite-separated-over-scheme}).

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-neighbourhood-scheme}
Let $S$ be a scheme. Consider a commutative diagram
$$
\xymatrix{
V' \ar[r] \ar[rd] & T' \times_T X \ar[r] \ar[d] & X \ar[d] \\
& T' \ar[r] & T
}
$$
Assume
\begin{enumerate}
\item $T' \to T$ is an etale morphism of affine schemes,
\item $X$ is an algebraic space,
\item $X \to T$ is a separated, locally quasi-finite morphism,
\item $V'$ is an open subspace of $T' \times_T X$, and
\item $V' \to T'$ is quasi-affine.
\end{enumerate}
In this situation the image $U$ of $V'$ in $X$ is a quasi-compact
open subspace of $X$ which is representable.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
We first make some trivial observations. 
Note that $V'$ is a representable by Lemma \ref{lemma-quasi-affine-local}.
It is also quasi-compact (as a quasi-affine scheme over an affine scheme, see
Morphisms, Lemma \ref{morphisms-lemma-quasi-affine-separated}).
Since $T' \times_T X \to X$ is etale
(Properties of Spaces, Lemma \ref{spaces-properties-lemma-base-change-etale})
the map $|T' \times_T X| \to |X|$ is open, see
Properties of Spaces, Lemma \ref{spaces-properties-lemma-etale-open}.
Let $U \subset X$ be the open subspace corresponding to the image of
$|V'|$, see
Properties of Spaces, Lemma \ref{spaces-properties-lemma-open-subspaces}.
As $|V'|$ is quasi-compact we see that $|U|$ is quasi-compact, hence
$U$ is a quasi-compact algebraic spaces, by 
Properties of Spaces, Lemma \ref{spaces-properties-lemma-quasi-compact-space}.

\medskip\noindent
By
Morphisms,
Lemma \ref{morphisms-lemma-locally-quasi-finite-qc-source-universally-bounded}
the morphism $T' \to T$ is universally bounded. Hence we can do induction on
the integer $n$ bounding the degree of the fibres of $T' \to T$, see
Morphisms, Lemma \ref{morphisms-lemma-etale-universally-bounded}
for a description of this integer in the case of an etale morphism.
If $n = 1$, then $T' \to T$ is an open immersion (see
Descent, Lemma \ref{descent-lemma-universally-injective-etale-open-immersion}),
and the result is clear. Assume $n > 1$.

\medskip\noindent
Consider the affine scheme $T'' = T' \times_T T'$.
As $T' \to T$ is etale we have a decomposition (into open and closed affine
subschemes) $T'' = \Delta(T') \amalg T^*$. Namely $\Delta = \Delta_{T'/T}$
is open by
Morphisms, Lemma \ref{morphisms-lemma-diagonal-unramfied-morphism}
and closed because $T' \to T$ is separated as a morphism of affines.
As a base change the degrees of the fibres of the second projection
$\text{pr}_1 : T' \times_T T' \to T'$ are bounded by $n$, see
Morphisms, Lemma \ref{morphisms-lemma-base-change-universally-bounded}.
On the other hand, $\text{pr}_1|_{\Delta(T')} : \Delta(T') \to T'$ is
an isomorphism and every fibre has exactly one point.
Thus, on applying
Morphisms, Lemma \ref{morphisms-lemma-etale-universally-bounded}
we conclude the degrees of the fibres of the restriction
$\text{pr}_1|_{T^*} : T^* \to T'$ are bounded by $n - 1$.
Hence the induction hypothesis applied to the diagram
$$
\xymatrix{
p_0^{-1}(V') \cap X^* \ar[r] \ar[rd] &
X^* \ar[r]_{p_1|_{X^*}} \ar[d] &
X' \ar[d] \\
& T^* \ar[r]^{\text{pr}_1|_{T^*}} & T'
}
$$
gives that $p_1(p_0^{-1}(V') \cap X^*)$
is a quasi-compact scheme. Here we set
$X'' = T'' \times_T X$, $X^* = T^* \times_T X$, and $X' = T' \times_T X$,
and $p_0, p_1 : X'' \to X'$ are the base changes of $\text{pr}_0, \text{pr}_1$.
Most of the hypotheses of the lemma imply
by base change the corresponding hypothesis for the diagram above.
For example $p_0^{-1}(V') = T'' \times_{T'} V'$
is a scheme quasi-affine over $T''$ as a base change. Some
verifications omitted.

\medskip\noindent
By
Properties of Spaces, Lemma \ref{spaces-properties-lemma-subscheme}
we conclude that
$$
p_1(p_0^{-1}(V')) =
V' \cup p_1(p_0^{-1}(V') \cap X^*)
$$
is a quasi-compact scheme. Moreover, it is clear that
$p_1(p_0^{-1}(V'))$ is the inverse image of the
quasi-compact open subspace $U \subset X$ discussed in the
first paragraph of the proof. In other words, $T' \times_T U$ is a scheme!
Note that $T' \times_T U$ is quasi-compact and
separated and locally quasi-finite over $T'$, as
$T' \times_T X \to T'$ is locally quasi-finite and separated
being a base change of the original morphism $X \to T$ (see
Lemmas \ref{lemma-base-change-separated} and
\ref{lemma-base-change-quasi-finite}).
This implies by
More on Morphisms,
Lemma \ref{more-morphisms-lemma-quasi-finite-separated-quasi-affine}
that $T' \times_T U \to T'$ is quasi-affine.

\medskip\noindent
By
Descent, Lemma \ref{descent-lemma-descent-data-sheaves}
this gives a descent datum on $T' \times_T U / T'$
relative to the etale covering $\{T' \to W\}$, where $W \subset T$
is the image of the morphism $T' \to T$.
Because $U'$ is quasi-affine over $T'$ we see from
Descent, Lemma \ref{descent-lemma-quasi-affine}
that this datum is effective, and by the last part of
Descent, Lemma \ref{descent-lemma-descent-data-sheaves}
this implies that $U$ is a scheme as desired.
Some minor details omitted.
\end{proof}

\begin{proposition}
\label{proposition-locally-quasi-finite-separated-over-scheme}
Let $S$ be a scheme.
Let $f : X \to T$ be a morphism of algebraic spaces.
Assume
\begin{enumerate}
\item $T$ is representable,
\item $f$ is locally quasi-finite, and
\item $f$ is separated.
\end{enumerate}
Then $X$ is representable.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
Let $T = \bigcup T_i$ be an affine open covering of the scheme $T$.
If we can show that the open subspaces $X_i = f^{-1}(T_i)$ are
representable, then $X$ is representable, see
Properties of Spaces, Lemma \ref{spaces-properties-lemma-subscheme}.
Note that $X_i = T_i \times_T X$ and that locally quasi-finite and
separated are both stable under base change, see
Lemmas \ref{lemma-base-change-separated} and
\ref{lemma-base-change-quasi-finite}.
Hence we may assume $T$ is an affine scheme.

\medskip\noindent
By
Properties of Spaces,
Lemma \ref{spaces-properties-lemma-union-of-quasi-compact}
there exists a Zariski covering $X = \bigcup X_i$
such that each $X_i$ has a surjective etale covering by
an affine scheme. By
Properties of Spaces, Lemma \ref{spaces-properties-lemma-subscheme}
again it suffices to prove the propostion for each $X_i$.
Hence we may assume there exists an affine scheme $U$ and a
surjective etale morphism $U \to X$. This reduces us to the
situation in the next paragraph.

\medskip\noindent
Assume we have
$$
U \longrightarrow X \longrightarrow T
$$
where $U$ and $T$ are affine schemes, $U \to X$ is etale surjective, and
$X \to T$ is separated and locally quasi-finite. By
Lemmas \ref{lemma-etale-locally-quasi-finite} and
\ref{lemma-composition-quasi-finite}
the morphism $U \to T$ is locally quasi-finite.
Since $U$ and $T$ are affine it is quasi-finite.
Set $R = U \times_X U$. Then $X = U/R$, see
Spaces, Lemma \ref{spaces-lemma-space-presentation}.
As $X \to T$ is separated the
morphism $R \to U \times_T U$ is a closed immersion, see
Lemma \ref{lemma-fibre-product-after-map}.
In particular $R$ is an affine scheme also.
As $U \to X$ is etale the projection morphisms
$t, s : R \to U$ are etale as well. In particular $s$ and $t$ are
quasi-finite, flat and of finite presentation (see
Morphisms, Lemmas \ref{morphisms-lemma-etale-locally-quasi-finite},
\ref{morphisms-lemma-etale-flat} and
\ref{morphisms-lemma-etale-locally-finite-presentation}).

\medskip\noindent
Let $(U, R, s, t, c)$ be the groupoid associated to the etale
equivalence relation $R$ on $U$. Let $u \in U$ be a point, and
denote $p \in T$ its image. We are going to use
Groupoids, Lemma \ref{groupoids-lemma-quasi-finite-over-base-j-proper}
for the groupoid $(U, R, s, t, c)$ over the scheme $T$ with
points $p$ and $u$ as above.
By the discussion in the previous paragraph all the
assumptions (1) -- (7) of that lemma are satisfied.
Hence we get an etale neighbourhood
$(T', p') \to (T, p)$ and disjoint union decompositions
$$
U_{T'} = U' \amalg W, \quad
R_{T'} = R' \amalg W'
$$
and $u' \in U'$ satisfying conclusions
(a), (b), (c), (d), (e), (f), (g), and (h) of the aforementioned
Groupoids, Lemma \ref{groupoids-lemma-quasi-finite-over-base-j-proper}.
We may and do assume that $T'$ is affine (after possibly shrinking $T'$).
Conclusion (h) implies that $R' = U' \times_{X_{T'}} U'$ with projection
mappings identified with the restrictions of $s'$ and $t'$.
Thus $(U', R', s'|_{R'}, t'|_{R'}, c'|_{R' \times_{t', U', s'} R'})$ of
conclusion (g) is an etale equivalence relation. By
Spaces, Lemma \ref{spaces-lemma-finding-opens}
we conclude that $U'/R'$ is an open subspace of $X_{T'}$. By conclusion (d)
the schemes $U'$, $R'$ are affine and the morphisms
$s'|_{R'}, t'|_{R'}$ are finite etale. Hence
Groupoids, Lemma \ref{groupoids-proposition-finite-flat-equivalence}
kicks in and we see that $U'/R'$ is an affine scheme.

\medskip\noindent
We conclude that for every pair of points $(u, p)$ as above we can
find an etale neighbourhood $(T', p') \to (T, p)$ with
$\kappa(p) = \kappa(p')$ and a point $u' \in U_{T'}$ mapping to $u$
such that the image $x'$ of $u'$ in $|X_{T'}|$ has an open neighbourhood
$V'$ in $X_{T'}$ which is an affine scheme. We apply
Lemma \ref{lemma-neighbourhood-scheme}
to obtain an open subspace $W \subset X$ which is a scheme, and
which contains $x$ (the image of $u$ in $|X|$).
Since this works for every $x$ we see that $X$
is a scheme by
Properties of Spaces, Lemma \ref{spaces-properties-lemma-subscheme}.
This ends the proof.
\end{proof}

\noindent
Here is another formulation of the result above.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-locally-quasi-finite-separated-representable}
Let $S$ be a scheme.
A locally quasi-finite and separated morphism of algebraic spaces
over $S$ is representable.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
This is immediate from
Proposition \ref{proposition-locally-quasi-finite-separated-over-scheme}
and the fact that being locally quasi-finite and separated is
preserved under any base change, see
Lemmas \ref{lemma-base-change-quasi-finite} and
\ref{lemma-base-change-separated}.
\end{proof}
