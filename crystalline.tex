\section{Introduction}
\label{section-introduction}

\noindent
This chapter is based on a lecture series given by Johan de Jong
held in 2012 at Columbia University.
The goals of this chapter are to give a quick introduction to
crystalline cohomology. A reference is the book \cite{Berthelot}.





\section{Divided powers}
\label{section-divided-powers}

\noindent
In this section we collect some results on divided power rings.
We will use the convention $0! = 1$ (as empty products should give $1$).

\begin{definition}
\label{definition-divided-powers}
Let $A$ be a ring. Let $I$ be an ideal of $A$. A collection of maps
$\gamma_n : I \to I$, $n > 0$ is called a {\it divided power structure}
on $I$ if for all $n \geq 0$, $m > 0$, $x, y \in I$, and $a \in A$ we have
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\gamma_1(x) = x$, we also set $\gamma_0(x) = 1$,
\item $\gamma_n(x)\gamma_m(x) = \frac{(n + m)!}{n! m!} \gamma_{n + m}(x)$,
\item $\gamma_n(ax) = a^n \gamma_n(x)$,
\item $\gamma_n(x + y) = \sum_{i = 0, \ldots, n} \gamma_i(x)\gamma_{n - i}(y)$,
\item $\gamma_n(\gamma_m(x)) = \frac{(nm)!}{n! (m!)^n} \gamma_{nm}(x)$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

\noindent
Some observations. Note that condition (2) implies that
$n \gamma_n(x) = \gamma_1(x)\gamma_{n - 1}(x)$. Hence by induction
and condition (1) we get $n! \gamma_n(x) = x^n$. Thus $\gamma_n(x)$
is a replacement for $x^n/n!$ in $I$. If $A$ is torsion free as a
$\mathbf{Z}$-module, then all the other axioms follow from this. 
Note that the rational numbers $\frac{(n + m)!}{n! m!}$ and
$\frac{(nm)!}{n! (m!)^n}$ occuring in the definition are in fact integers.

\begin{example}
\label{example-ideal-generated-by-p}
Let $p$ be a prime number.
Let $A$ be a ring such that every integer $n$ not divisible by $p$
is invertible, i.e., $A$ is a $\mathbf{Z}_{(p)}$-algebra. Then
$I = pA$ has a canonical divided power structure. Namely, given
$x = pa \in A$ we set
$$
\gamma_n(x) = \frac{p^n}{n!} a^n
$$
The reader verifies immediately that $p^n/n!$ is an integer so that
the definition makes sense. It is a straightforward exercise to
verify that conditions (1) -- (5) of
Definition \ref{definition-divided-powers} are satisfied.
\end{example}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-need-only-gamma-p}
Let $p$ be a prime number. Let $A$ be a ring such that every integer $n$
not divisible by $p$ is invertible, i.e., $A$ is a $\mathbf{Z}_{(p)}$-algebra.
Let $I \subset A$ be an ideal. Two divided power structures
$\gamma, \gamma'$ on $I$ are equal if and only if $\gamma_p = \gamma'_p$.
Moreover, given a map $\delta : I \to I$ such that
\begin{enumerate}
\item $p!\delta(x) = x^p$ for all $x \in I$,
\item $\delta(ax) = a^p\delta(x)$ for all $a \in A$, $x \in I$, and
\item
$\delta(x + y) =
\delta(x) +
\sum\nolimits_{i + j = p, i,j \geq 1} \frac{x^i}{i!}\frac{y^j}{j!} +
\delta(y)$ for all $x, y \in I$,
\end{enumerate}
then there exists a unique divided power structure $\gamma$ on $I$ such
that $\gamma_p = \delta$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
If $n$ is not divisible by $p$, then $\gamma_n(x) = c x \gamma_{n - 1}(x)$
where $c$ is a unit in $\mathbf{Z}_{(p)}$. Moreover,
$$
\gamma_{pm}(x) = c \gamma_m(\gamma_p(x))
$$
where $c$ is a unit in $\mathbf{Z}_{(p)}$. Thus the first assertion is clear.
For the second assertion, we can, working backwards, use these equalities
to define all $\gamma_n$. Then a long and tedious computation shows all
the axioms are satisfied if $\delta$ satisfies (1), (2), (3).
Details omitted.
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}
\label{definition-divided-power-ring}
A {\it divided power ring} is a triple $(A, I, \gamma)$ where
$A$ is a ring, $I \subset A$ is an ideal, and $\gamma = (\gamma_n)_{n \geq 1}$
is a divided power structure on $I$.
A {\it homomorphism of divided power rings}
$\varphi : (A, I, \gamma) \to (B, J, \delta)$ is a ring homomorphism
$\varphi : A \to B$ such that $\varphi(I) \subset J$ and such that
$\delta_n(\varphi(x)) = \varphi(\gamma_n(x))$ for all $x \in I$.
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-nil}
Let $p$ be a prime number.
If $(A, I, \gamma)$ is a divided power ring and $p$ is nilpotent
in $A$, then $I$ is locally nilpotent.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
If $p^N = 0$ in $A$, then for $x \in I$ we have
$x^{pN} = (pN)!\gamma_N(x) = 0$ because $(pN)!$ is
divisible by $p^N$.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-colimits}
The category of divided power rings has all limits and colimits.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Empty limit: zero ring (that's weird but we need it).
Products: Exactly what you think they should be.
Equalizers: As in rings.
Empty colimit: $\mathbf{Z}$ with PD-ideal $(0)$.
General Colimits. Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a category and let
$c \mapsto (A_c, I_c, \gamma_c)$ be a diagram. Consider the functor
$$
F(B, J, \delta) = \lim_{c \in \mathcal{C}}
Hom((A_c, I_c, \gamma_c), (B, J, \delta))
$$
Note that any $f = (f_c)_{c \in C} \in F(B, J, \delta)$ has the property
that all the images $f_c(A_c)$ generate a subring $B'$ of $B$ of bounded
cardinality $\kappa$ and that all the images $f_c(I_c)$ generate a
divided power sub ideal $J'$ of $B'$. And we get a factorization of
$f$ as a $f'$ in $F(B')$ followed by the inclusion $B' \to B$.
Hence we see that $F(B, J, \delta)$ can be computed if we know the value
of $F$ on divided power rings of
cardinality $\kappa$ or less. Consider a set of objects $U$ of
dividing power rings containing an object isomorphic to every
$(B, J, \delta)$ of cardinality
at most $\kappa$. Then
$$
\lim_{(B, J, \delta) \in U, f \in F(B, J, \delta)} (B, J, \delta)
$$
will be the colimit we wanted to construct.
\end{proof}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Divided power envelope of an ideal.
\item The diagonal and the module of differentials. Important!
\item We probably don't need this, but here it is.
Berthelot's compatibility condition (weaker than homomorphism
of divided power rings): given $(A, I, \gamma) \to (B, J, \delta)$
require that $\delta$ extends to $J + IB$ compatibly with $\gamma$.
\item Given $(A, I, \gamma)$ and $\varphi : A \to B$, then $\gamma$
extends to $IB$ if one of the following conditions is satisfied:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $IB = 0$,
\item $A \to B$ is flat, or
\item $I$ is (locally) principal.
\end{enumerate}
\item Divided power algebras and flat base change... see
\cite[Proposition 2.1.7]{dJ-crystalline}. Used for closed immersions
and crystals...
\end{enumerate}





\section{Crystalline site}
\label{section-site}

\noindent
We can use either the big site or the small site.
There is also a syntomic site (sometimes useful).

\begin{enumerate}
\item Talk about divided power thickenings $(S, T, \gamma)$.
\item To simplify work over an affine base $(A, I, \gamma)$?
Always denote the base $\Sigma = \Spec(A)$.
\item Get around compatibility by looking only at $X$ lying over
$V(I)$?
\item Introduce $\text{Cris}(X/\Sigma, I, \gamma)$ and
$\text{CRIS}(X/\Sigma, I, \gamma)$.
\item Talk about fibre products and products in these sites.
Talk about coverings. Talk about sheaves.
\item Functoriality of crystalline topos? This is a bit tricky...
Probably should go later.
\end{enumerate}






\section{Crystals in finite locally free modules}
\label{section-crystals}

\noindent
Of course you can define crystals in much greater generality.

\begin{enumerate}
\item First discuss $\mathcal{O}$-modules $\mathcal{F}$.
\item Discuss the canonical connection
$\nabla : \mathcal{F} \to \mathcal{F} \otimes \Omega$
on the crystalline site.
\item Briefly discuss quasi-coherent modules.
\item Introduce crystals $=$ crystals in finite locally free modules.
\item Discuss the equivalence of the category of crystals with the
category of modules with integrable, topologically quasi-nilpotent
connection in the affine case. (Uses the divided power envelope for the
first time...?)
\end{enumerate}






\section{Cohomology of crystals}
\label{section-cohomology}

\noindent
In this section we compare crystalline cohomology with de Rham
cohomology. We follow \cite{Bhatt}.

\begin{enumerate}
\item The main theorem in the affine case.
\item The main theorem in the global case.
\end{enumerate}
