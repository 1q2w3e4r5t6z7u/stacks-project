\section{Introduction}
\label{section-introduction}

\noindent
This chapter is based on a lecture series given by Johan de Jong
held in 2012 at Columbia University.
The goals of this chapter are to give a quick introduction to
crystalline cohomology. A reference is the book \cite{Berthelot}.





\section{Divided powers}
\label{section-divided-powers}

\noindent
In this section we collect some results on divided power rings.
We will use the convention $0! = 1$ (as empty products should give $1$).

\begin{definition}
\label{definition-divided-powers}
Let $A$ be a ring. Let $I$ be an ideal of $A$. A collection of maps
$\gamma_n : I \to I$, $n > 0$ is called a {\it divided power structure}
on $I$ if for all $n \geq 0$, $m > 0$, $x, y \in I$, and $a \in A$ we have
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\gamma_1(x) = x$, we also set $\gamma_0(x) = 1$,
\item $\gamma_n(x)\gamma_m(x) = \frac{(n + m)!}{n! m!} \gamma_{n + m}(x)$,
\item $\gamma_n(ax) = a^n \gamma_n(x)$,
\item $\gamma_n(x + y) = \sum_{i = 0, \ldots, n} \gamma_i(x)\gamma_{n - i}(y)$,
\item $\gamma_n(\gamma_m(x)) = \frac{(nm)!}{n! (m!)^n} \gamma_{nm}(x)$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

\noindent
Some observations. Note that condition (2) implies that
$n \gamma_n(x) = \gamma_1(x)\gamma_{n - 1}(x)$. Hence by induction
and condition (1) we get $n! \gamma_n(x) = x^n$. Thus $\gamma_n(x)$
is a replacement for $x^n/n!$ in $I$. If $A$ is torsion free as a
$\mathbf{Z}$-module, then all the other axioms follow from this. 
Note that the rational numbers $\frac{(n + m)!}{n! m!}$ and
$\frac{(nm)!}{n! (m!)^n}$ occuring in the definition are in fact integers.

\begin{example}
\label{example-ideal-generated-by-p}
Let $p$ be a prime number.
Let $A$ be a ring such that every integer $n$ not divisible by $p$
is invertible, i.e., $A$ is a $\mathbf{Z}_{(p)}$-algebra. Then
$I = pA$ has a canonical divided power structure. Namely, given
$x = pa \in A$ we set
$$
\gamma_n(x) = \frac{p^n}{n!} a^n
$$
The reader verifies immediately that $p^n/n!$ is an integer so that
the definition makes sense. It is a straightforward exercise to
verify that conditions (1) -- (5) of
Definition \ref{definition-divided-powers} are satisfied.
\end{example}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-need-only-gamma-p}
Let $p$ be a prime number. Let $A$ be a ring such that every integer $n$
not divisible by $p$ is invertible, i.e., $A$ is a $\mathbf{Z}_{(p)}$-algebra.
Let $I \subset A$ be an ideal. Two divided power structures
$\gamma, \gamma'$ on $I$ are equal if and only if $\gamma_p = \gamma'_p$.
Moreover, given a map $\delta : I \to I$ such that
\begin{enumerate}
\item $p!\delta(x) = x^p$ for all $x \in I$,
\item $\delta(ax) = a^p\delta(x)$ for all $a \in A$, $x \in I$, and
\item
$\delta(x + y) =
\delta(x) +
\sum\nolimits_{i + j = p, i,j \geq 1} \frac{x^i}{i!}\frac{y^j}{j!} +
\delta(y)$ for all $x, y \in I$,
\end{enumerate}
then there exists a unique divided power structure $\gamma$ on $I$ such
that $\gamma_p = \delta$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
If $n$ is not divisible by $p$, then $\gamma_n(x) = c x \gamma_{n - 1}(x)$
where $c$ is a unit in $\mathbf{Z}_{(p)}$. Moreover,
$$
\gamma_{pm}(x) = c \gamma_m(\gamma_p(x))
$$
where $c$ is a unit in $\mathbf{Z}_{(p)}$. Thus the first assertion is clear.
For the second assertion, we can, working backwards, use these equalities
to define all $\gamma_n$. Then a long and tedious computation shows all
the axioms are satisfied if $\delta$ satisfies (1), (2), (3).
Details omitted.
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}
\label{definition-divided-power-ring}
A {\it divided power ring} is a triple $(A, I, \gamma)$ where
$A$ is a ring, $I \subset A$ is an ideal, and $\gamma = (\gamma_n)_{n \geq 1}$
is a divided power structure on $I$.
A {\it homomorphism of divided power rings}
$\varphi : (A, I, \gamma) \to (B, J, \delta)$ is a ring homomorphism
$\varphi : A \to B$ such that $\varphi(I) \subset J$ and such that
$\delta_n(\varphi(x)) = \varphi(\gamma_n(x))$ for all $x \in I$.
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-nil}
Let $p$ be a prime number. Let $(A, I, \gamma)$ be a divided power ring
and assume $p$ is nilpotent in $A/I$.
Then $I$ is locally nilpotent if and only if $p$ is nilpotent in $A$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
If $p^N = 0$ in $A$, then for $x \in I$ we have
$x^{pN} = (pN)!\gamma_N(x) = 0$ because $(pN)!$ is
divisible by $p^N$. Conversely, assume $I$ is locally nilpotent.
We've also assumed that $p$ is nilpotent in $A/I$, hence
$p^r \in I$ for some $r$, hence $p^r$ nilpotent, hence $p$ nilpotent.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-colimits}
The category of divided power rings has all limits and colimits.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
The empty limit is the zero ring (that's weird but we need it).
The product of a collection of divided power rings $(A_t, I_t, \gamma_t)$,
$t \in T$ is given by $(\prod A_t, \prod I_t, \gamma)$ where
$\gamma_n((x_t)) = (\gamma_{t, n}(x_t))$.
The equalizer of $\alpha, \beta : (A, I, \gamma) \to (B, J, \delta)$
is just $C = \{a \in A \mid \alpha(a) = \beta(a)\}$ with ideal $C \cap I$
and induced divided powers. It follows that all limits exist, see
Categories, Lemma \ref{categories-lemma-limits-products-equalizers}.
Moreover, limits commute with the forgetful functor from divided
power rings to rings.

\medskip\noindent
The empty colimit is $\mathbf{Z}$ with divided power ideal $(0)$.
Let's discuss general colimits. Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a category and let
$c \mapsto (A_c, I_c, \gamma_c)$ be a diagram. Consider the functor
$$
F(B, J, \delta) = \lim_{c \in \mathcal{C}}
Hom((A_c, I_c, \gamma_c), (B, J, \delta))
$$
Note that any $f = (f_c)_{c \in C} \in F(B, J, \delta)$ has the property
that all the images $f_c(A_c)$ generate a subring $B'$ of $B$ of bounded
cardinality $\kappa$ and that all the images $f_c(I_c)$ generate a
divided power sub ideal $J'$ of $B'$. And we get a factorization of
$f$ as a $f'$ in $F(B')$ followed by the inclusion $B' \to B$.
Hence we see that $F(B, J, \delta)$ can be computed if we know the value
of $F$ on divided power rings of
cardinality $\kappa$ or less. Consider a set of objects $U$ of
dividing power rings containing an object isomorphic to every
$(B, J, \delta)$ of cardinality
at most $\kappa$. Then
$$
\lim_{(B, J, \delta) \in U, f \in F(B, J, \delta)} (B, J, \delta)
$$
will be the colimit we wanted to construct.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-divided-power-envelope}
Let $(A, I, \gamma)$ be a divided power ring.
Let $A \to B$ be a ring map. Let $J \subset B$ be an ideal
with $IB \subset J$. There exists a homomorphism of
divided power rings
$$
(A, I, \gamma) \longrightarrow (D_B(J), \bar J, \bar \gamma)
$$
such that
$$
\Hom_{(A, I, \gamma)}((D_B(J), \bar J, \bar \gamma), (C, K, \delta))
=
\Hom_A((B, J), (C, K))
$$
functorially in the divided power algebra $(C, K, \delta)$ over
$(A, I, \gamma)$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Entirely similar to the proof of Lemma \ref{lemma-colimits}.
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}
\label{definition-divided-power-envelope}
Let $(A, I, \gamma)$ be a divided power ring.
Let $A \to B$ be a ring map. Let $J \subset B$ be an ideal
with $IB \subset J$. The divided power algebra $D_B(J)$
constructed in Lemma \ref{lemma-divided-power-envelope}
is called the {\it divided power envelope of $J$ in $B$
relative to $(A, I, \gamma)$}.
\end{definition}

\noindent
Discussion. There is an $A$-algebra map $B \to D_B(J)$ which
maps $J$ into $\bar J$. In fact, $\bar J$ is generated by
the elements $\bar\gamma_n(x)$ where $x$ is in the image of
$J \to D_B(J)$ (think $x \in J$). Let $(A, I, \gamma) \to (C, K, \delta)$
be a homomorphism of divided power rings. The universal property is
just that ring maps $B \to C$ which map $J$ into $K$ correspond
1-to-1 to homomorphisms of divided power rings
$(D_B(J), \bar J, \bar \gamma) \to (C, K, \delta)$ via precomposing with the
canonical map $B \to D_B(J)$.

\medskip\noindent
The following lemma can be generalized to the case where $B$ and $B'$
come with their own divided power ideals... see
\cite[Proposition 2.1.7]{dJ-crystalline}.
Anyway, it in particular says that taking the divided power
envelope commutes with localization.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-flat-base-change-divided-power-envelope}
Let $(A, I, \gamma)$ be a divided power ring.
Let $B \to B'$ be a homomorphism of $A$-algebras.
Let $IB \subset J \subset B$ be an ideal.
Assume that $B/IB \to B'/IB'$ is flat.
Then $D_B(J) \otimes_B B' = D_{B'}(JB')$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Omitted.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-gamma-extends}
Let $(A, I, \gamma)$ be a divided power ring.
Let $A \to B$ be a ring map. Then $\gamma$ 
extends to $IB$ if one of the following conditions is satisfied:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $IB = 0$,
\item $A \to B$ is flat, or
\item $I$ is (locally) principal.
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Omitted.
\end{proof}




\section{Compatibility}
\label{section-compatibility}

\noindent
This section isn't required reading; it explains how our discussion
fits with that of \cite{Berthelot}.
Consider the following technical notion.

\begin{definition}
\label{definition-compatible}
Let $(A, I, \gamma)$ and $(B, J, \delta)$ be divided power rings.
Let $A \to B$ be a ring map. We say
{\it $\delta$ is compatible with $\gamma$}
if there exists a divided power structure $\bar\gamma$ on
$J + IB$ such that
$$
(A, I, \gamma) \to (B, J + IB, \bar \gamma)\quad\text{and}\quad
(B, J, \delta) \to (B, J + IB, \bar \gamma)
$$
are homomorphisms of divided power rings.
\end{definition}

\noindent
Let $p$ be a prime number. Let $(A, I, \gamma)$ be a divided power ring.
Let $A \to C$ be a ring map with $p$ nilpotent in $C$.
Assume that $\gamma$ extends to $IC$ (see
Lemma \ref{lemma-gamma-extends}).
In this situation, the (big affine) crystalline site of
$\Spec(C)$ over $\Spec(A)$
as defined in \cite{Berthelot} 
is the opposite of the category of systems
$$
(B, J, \delta, A \to B, C \to B/J)
$$
where
\begin{enumerate}
\item $(B, J, \delta)$ is a divided power ring with $p$ nilpotent in $B$,
\item $\delta$ is compatible with $\gamma$, and
\item the diagram
$$
\xymatrix{
B \ar[r] & B/J \\
A \ar[u] \ar[r] & C \ar[u]
}
$$
is commutative.
\end{enumerate}
The conditions
``$\gamma$ extends to $C$ and $\delta$ compatible with $\gamma$''
are used in \cite{Berthelot} to insure that
the crystalline cohomology of $\Spec(C)$ is the same as the crystalline
cohomology of $\Spec(C/IC)$. We will avoid this issue
by working exclusively with $C$ such that $IC = 0$\footnote{Of course there
will be a price to pay.}. In this case,
for a system $(B, J, \delta, A \to B, C \to B/J)$ as above,
the commutativity of the displayed diagram above implies $IB \subset J$ and
compatibility is equivalent to the condition that
$(A, I, \gamma) \to (B, J, \delta)$ is a homomorphism of divided
power rings.




\section{Affine crystalline site}
\label{section-affine-site}

\noindent
In this section we put some algebra related to the crystalline site.
Note that usually the prime number $p$ will be contained in the
divided power ideal $I$.

\begin{definition}
\label{definition-affine-thickening}
Let $p$ be a prime number. Let $(A, I, \gamma)$ be a divided power
ring such that $A$ is a $\mathbf{Z}_{(p)}$-algebra. Let $A \to C$ be a
ring map such that $IC = 0$ and $p$ is nilpotent in $C$.
A {\it divided power thickening} of $C$ over $(A, I, \gamma)$
is a homomorphism of divided power algebras
$(A, I, \gamma) \to (B, J, \delta)$ such that $p$ is nilpotent in $B$
and a ring map $C \to B/J$ such that
$$
\xymatrix{
B \ar[r] & B/J \\
& C \ar[u] \\
A \ar[uu] \ar[r] & A/I \ar[u]
}
$$
is commutative. A {\it homomorphism of divided power thickenings}
is defined in the obvious way. We denote $\text{CRIS}(C/A, I, \gamma)$
or simply $\text{CRIS}(C/A)$ the category of divided power thickenings
of $C$ over $(A, I, \gamma)$.
\end{definition}

\noindent
Note that for a divided power thickening $(B, J, \delta)$ as above
the ideal $J$ is locally nilpotent, see Lemma \ref{lemma-nil}.
This category does not have equalizers or fibre products in general.
It also doesn't have an initial object ($=$ empty colimit) in general.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-affine-thickenings-colimits}
Assumptions and notation as in Definition \ref{definition-affine-thickening}.
The category $\text{CRIS}(A/C)$ has products.
It also has all finite nonempty colimits.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
The empty product is $(C, 0, \emptyset)$.
If $(B_t, J_t, \delta_t)$ is a family of divided power thickenings
then we can form the product $(\prod B_t, \prod J_t, \prod \delta_t)$
as in Lemma \ref{lemma-colimits}. The map
$C \to \prod B_t/\prod J_t = \prod B_t/J_t$ is clear.

\medskip\noindent
Given two objects $(B, J, \gamma)$ and $(B', J', \gamma')$ we can
form a cocartesian diagram
$$
\xymatrix{
(B, J, \gamma) \ar[r] & (B'', J'', \delta'') \\
(A, I, \gamma) \ar[r] \ar[u] & (B', J', \delta') \ar[u]
}
$$
in the category of divided power rings. Then we see that we have
$$
B''/J'' = B/J \otimes_{A/I} B'/J' \longleftarrow C \otimes_{A/I} C
$$ (details omitted). Denote $J'' \subset K \subset B''$ the ideal
such that
$$
\xymatrix{
B''/J'' \ar[r] & B''/K \\
C \otimes_{A/I} C \ar[r] \ar[u] & C \ar[u]
}
$$
is a pushout. Let $D = D_{B''}(K)$ be the divided power envelope of
$K$ in $B''$ relative to $(B'', J'', \delta'')$. Then it is
easily verified that $(D, \bar K, \bar \delta)$ is a coproduct
of $(B, J, \delta)$ and $(B', J', \delta')$ in the category
of affine thickenings.

\medskip\noindent
Next, we come to coequalizers. Let
$\alpha, \beta : (B, J, \delta) \to (B', J', \delta')$ be
morphisms of divided power thickenings over $(A, I, \gamma)$.
Consider $B'' = B'/ (\alpha(b) - \beta(b))$. Let $J'' \subset B''$
be the image of $J'$. Let $D = D_{B''}(J'')$ be the divided power envelope of
$J''$ in $B''$ relative to $(B', J', \delta')$. Then it is
easily verified that $(D, \bar K, \bar \delta)$ is the coequalizer
of $(B, J, \delta)$ and $(B', J', \delta')$ in the category
of affine thickenings.

\medskip\noindent
By Categories, Lemma \ref{categories-lemma-almost-finite-colimits-exist}
we have all finite nonempty colimits.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-set-generators}
Let $p$, $(A, I, \gamma)$, and $A \to C$ be as in
Definition \ref{definition-affine-thickening}.
Let $P$ be a polynomial algebra over $A$ and let
$P \to C$ be a surjection of $A$-algebras with kernel $K$.
For every $n \geq 1$ set $P_n = P/p^nP$ and $K_n \subset P_n$
the image of $K$ and
$$
D_n = D_{P_n}(K_n)
$$
where the divided power envelope is taken relative to $(A, I, \gamma)$.
Then $D_n$ is an object of $\text{CRIS}(C/A)$ and for every object
$(B, J, \delta)$ of $\text{CRIS}(C/A)$ there exists an $n$ and
a morphsm $D_n \to B$ of $\text{CRIS}(C/A)$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
We just prove the final assertion.
We can find an $A$-algebra homomorphism $P \to B$
lifting the map $C \to B/J$. By definition $p^nB = 0$ for
some $n$ hence $P \to B$ factors as $P \to P_n \to B$.
By the universal property of the divided power envelope we
conclude that $P_n \to B$ factors through $D_n$.
\end{proof}







\section{Module of differentials}
\label{section-differentials}

\noindent
In this section we develop a theory of modules of differentials
for divided power rings.

\begin{definition}
\label{definition-derivation}
Let $(A, I, \gamma) \to (B, J, \delta)$ be a homomorphism
of divided power rings. Let $M$ be an $B$-module.
An {\it divided power $A$-derivation} into $M$ is a map
$\theta : B \to M$ which is additive, annihilates the elements
of $A$, satisfies the Leibniz rule
$\theta(bb') = b\theta(b') + b'\theta(b)$ and satisfies
$$
\theta(\gamma_n(x)) = \gamma_{n - 1}(x)\theta(x)
$$
for all $n \geq 1$ and all $x \in J$.
\end{definition}

\noindent
As in the case of usual derivations, there exists a
{\it universal divided power $A$-derivation} $d_{A/B} : B \to \Omega_{B/A}$
such that any derivation $\theta : B \to M$ is equal to
$\theta = \xi \circ d_{B/A}$ for some $B$-linear map $\Omega_{B/A} \to M$.

\medskip\noindent
Let $(A, I, \gamma)$ be a divided power ring. In this setting the
correct version of the powers of $I$ is given by the divided powers
$$
I^{[n]} = \text{ideal generate by }
\gamma_{e_1}(x_1) \ldots \gamma_{e_t}(x_t)
\text{ with }\sum e_j \geq n\text{ and }x_j \in I.
$$
Of course we have $I^n \subset I^{[n]}$. Note that $I^{[1]} = I$.
Sometimes we also set $I^{[0]} = A$.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-diagonal-and-differentials}
Let $(A, I, \gamma) \to (B, J, \delta)$ be a homomorphism
of divided power rings. Let $(B(1), J(1), \delta(1))$ be the coproduct
of $(B, J, \delta)$ with itself over $(A, I, \gamma)$, i.e.,
such that
$$
\xymatrix{
(B, J, \delta) \ar[r] & (B(1), J(1), \delta(1)) \\
(A, I, \gamma) \ar[r] \ar[u] & (B, J, \delta) \ar[u]
}
$$
is cocartesian. Denote $K = \text{Ker}(B(1) \to B)$.
Then $K \cap J(1) \subset J(1)$ is preserved by the divided power
structure and
$$
\Omega_{B/A} = K/ \left(K^2 + (K \cap J(1))^{[2]}\right)
$$
canonically.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
The fact that $K \cap J(1) \subset J(1)$ is preserved by the divided power
structure follows from the fact that $B(1) \to B$ is a homomorphism of
divided power rings.

\medskip\noindent
Recall that $K/K^2$ has a canonical $B$-module structure.
Denote $s_0, s_1 : B \to B(1)$ the two coprojections and consider
the map $\text{d} : B \to K/K^2 +(K \cap J(1))^{[2]}$ given by
$b \mapsto s_0(b) - s_1(b)$. It is clear that $\text{d}$ is additive,
annihilates $A$, and satisfies the Leibniz rule.
We claim that $\text{d}$ is an $A$-derivation.
Let $x \in J$. Set $y = s_0(x)$ and $z = s_1(x)$.
Denote $\delta$ the divided power structure on $J(1)$.
We have to show that $\delta_n(y) - \delta_n(z) = \delta_{n - 1}(y)(y - z)$
modulo $K^2 +(K \cap J(1))^{[2]}$ for $n \geq 1$. We will show this
by induction on $n$. It is true for $n = 1$.
Let $n > 1$ and that it holds for all smaller values.
Note that
$$
\delta_n(z - y) =
\sum\nolimits_{i = 0}^n (-1)^{n - i}\delta_i(z)\delta_{n - i}(y)
$$
is an element of $K^2 +(K \cap J(1))^{[2]}$. From this and induction
we see that working modulo $K^2 +(K \cap J(1))^{[2]}$ we have
\begin{align*}
& \delta_n(y) - \delta_n(z) \\
& =
\delta_n(y) +
\sum\nolimits_{i = 0}^{n - 1} (-1)^{n - i}\delta_i(z)\delta_{n - i}(y) \\
& =
\delta_n(y) + (-1)^n\delta_n(y) +
\sum\nolimits_{i = 1}^{n - 1}
(-1)^{n - i}(\delta_i(y) - \delta_{i - 1}(y)(y - z))\delta_{n - i}(y)
\end{align*}
Using that $\delta_i(y)\delta_{n - i}(y) = \binom{n}{i} \delta_n(y)$
and that $\delta_{i - 1}(y)\delta_{n - i}(y) =
\binom{n - 1}{i} \delta_{n - 1}(y)$
the reader easily verifies that this expression comes out to give
$\delta_{n - 1}(y)(y - z)$ as desired.

\medskip\noindent
Let $M$ be a $B$-module. Let $\theta : B \to M$ be a divided power
$A$-derivation.
Set $D = B \oplus M$ where $M$ is an ideal of square zero. Define a
divided power structure on $J \oplus M \subset D$ by setting
$\delta_n(x + m) = \delta_n(x) + \delta_{n - 1}(x)m$ for $n > 1$.
There are two divided power algebra homomorphisms $B \to D$: the first
is given by the inclusion and the second by the map $b \mapsto b + \theta(b)$.
Hence we get a canonical homomorphism $B(1) \to D$ of divided power
algebras over $(A, I, \gamma)$. This induces a map $K \to M$
which annihilates $K^2$ (as $M$ is an ideal of square zero) and
$(K \cap J(1))^{[2]}$ as $M^{[2]} = 0$. It follows that $\text{d}$
is a universal divided power $A$-derivation and we win.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-diagonal-and-differentials-affine-site}
Let $p$, $(A, I, \gamma)$, and $A \to C$ as in
Definition \ref{definition-affine-thickening}.
Let $(B, J, \delta)$ be a divided power thickening of $C$ over
$(A, I, \gamma)$. Let $(B(1), J(1), \delta(1))$ be the coproduct
of $(B, J, \delta)$ with itself in the category of divided power
thickenings of $C$ over $(A, I, \gamma)$. Denote
$K = \text{Ker}(B(1) \to B)$. Then $K \cap J(1) \subset J(1)$
is preserved by the divided power structure and
$$
\Omega_{B/A} = K/ \left(K^2 + (K \cap J(1))^{[2]}\right)
$$
canonically.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Word for word the same as the proof of
Lemma \ref{lemma-diagonal-and-differentials}.
The only point that has to be checked is that the
divided power ring $D = B \oplus M$ is a
divided power thickening of $C$ over $(A, I, \gamma)$
and that the two maps $B \to C$ are homomorphisms of
divided power thickenings of $C$ over $(A, I, \gamma)$.
Since $D/(J \oplus M) = B/J$ we can use $C \to B/J$
and everything is clear from the construction.
\end{proof}



\section{Divided power schemes}
\label{section-divided-power-schemes}

\noindent
Some remarks on how to globalize the previous notions.

\begin{definition}
\label{definition-divided-power-structure}
Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a site. Let $\mathcal{O}$ be a sheaf of rings
on $\mathcal{C}$. Let $\mathcal{I} \subset \mathcal{O}$ be a
sheaf of ideals. A {\it divided power structure $\gamma$} on $\mathcal{I}$
is a sequence of maps $\gamma_n : \mathcal{I} \to \mathcal{I}$, $n \geq 1$
such that for any object $U$ of $\mathcal{C}$ the triple
$$
(\mathcal{O}(U), \mathcal{I}(U), \gamma)
$$
is a divided power ring.
\end{definition}

\noindent
To be sure this applies in particular to sheaves of rings on
topological spaces. But it's good to be a little bit more general
as the structure sheaf of the crystalline site lives on a... site!
A triple $(\mathcal{C}, \mathcal{I}, \gamma)$ as in the
definition above is sometimes called a {\it divided power topos}
in this chapter. Given a second $(\mathcal{C}', \mathcal{I}', \gamma')$ and
given a morphism of ringed topoi
$(f, f^\sharp) : (\Sh(\mathcal{C}), \mathcal{O}) \to
(\Sh(\mathcal{C}'), \mathcal{O}')$
we say that $(f, f^\sharp)$ induces a {\it morphism of divided
power topoi} if $f^\sharp(f^{-1}\mathcal{I}') \subset \mathcal{I}$
and the diagrams
$$
\xymatrix{
f^{-1}\mathcal{I}' \ar[d]_{f^{-1}\gamma'_n} \ar[r]_{f^\sharp} &
\mathcal{I} \ar[d]^{\gamma_n} \\
f^{-1}\mathcal{I}' \ar[r]^{f^\sharp} & \mathcal{I}
}
$$
are commutative for all $n \geq 1$. If $f$ comes from a morphism of
sites induced by a functor $u : \mathcal{C}' \to \mathcal{C}$ then
this just means that
$$
(\mathcal{O}'(U'), \mathcal{I}'(U'), \gamma')
\longrightarrow
(\mathcal{O}(u(U')), \mathcal{I}(u(U')), \gamma)
$$
is a homomorphism of divided power rings for all $U' \in \Ob(\mathcal{C}')$.

\medskip\noindent
In the case of schemes we require the divided power ideal to be
{\bf quasi-coherent}. But apart from this the definition is exactly
the same as in the case of topoi. Here it is.

\begin{definition}
\label{definition-divided-power-scheme}
A {\it divided power scheme} is a triple $(S, \mathcal{I}, \gamma)$
where $S$ is a scheme, $\mathcal{I}$ is a quasi-coherent sheaf of
ideals, and $\gamma$ is a divided power structure on $\mathcal{I}$.
A {\it morphism of divided power schemes}
$(S, \mathcal{I}, \gamma) \to (S', \mathcal{I}', \gamma')$ is
a morphism of schemes $f : S \to S'$ such that
$f^{-1}\mathcal{I}'\mathcal{O}_S \subset \mathcal{I}$ and such that
$$
(\mathcal{O}_S(U'), \mathcal{I}(U'), \gamma)
\longrightarrow
(\mathcal{O}_{S'}(f^{-1}U'), \mathcal{I}(f^{-1}U'), \gamma)
$$
is a homomorphism of divided power rings for all $U' \subset S'$ open.
\end{definition}

\noindent
Recall that there is a 1-to-1 correspondence between quasi-coherent
sheaves of ideals and closed immersions, see
Morphisms, Section \ref{morphisms-section-closed-immersions}.
Thus given a divided power scheme $(T, \mathcal{J}, \gamma)$ we
get a canonical closed immersion $U \to T$ defined by $\mathcal{J}$.
Conversely, given a closed immersion $U \to T$ and a divided power
structure $\gamma$ on the sheaf of ideals $\mathcal{J}$ associated
to $U \to T$ we obtain a divided power scheme $(T, \mathcal{J}, \gamma)$.
In many situations we only want to consider such triples
$(U, T, \gamma)$ when the morphism $U \to T$ is a thickening, see
More on Morphisms, Definition \ref{more-morphisms-definition-thickening}.

\begin{definition}
\label{definition-divided-power-thickening}
A triple $(U, T, \gamma)$ as above is called a {\it divided power thickening}
if $U \to T$ is a thickening.
\end{definition}

\noindent
We make the following observation. Suppose that $(U, T, \gamma)$
is triple as above. Assume that $T$ is a scheme over $\mathbf{Z}_{(p)}$
and that $p$ is locally nilpotent on $U$. Then we have
$$
p\text{ locally nilpotent on }T
\Leftrightarrow
U \to T\text{ is a thickening}
$$
See Lemma \ref{lemma-nil}.





\section{Crystalline site}
\label{section-site}

\noindent
We first define the big site. Given a divided power scheme
$(S, \mathcal{I}, \gamma)$ we say $(T, \mathcal{J}, \delta)$ is
a divided power scheme over $(S, \mathcal{I}, \gamma)$ if
$T$ comes endowed with a morphism $T \to S$ of divided power
schemes. Similarly, we say a divided power thickening $(U, T, \delta)$
is a divided power thickening over $(S, \mathcal{I}, \gamma)$
if $T$ comes endowed with a morphism $T \to S$ of divided power
schemes.

\begin{definition}
\label{definition-divided-power-thickening-X}
Let $p$ be a prime number. Let $(S, \mathcal{I}, \gamma)$ be a divided power
scheme over $\mathbf{Z}_{(p)}$. Let $f : X \to S$ be a morphism of schemes
such that $f^{-1}\mathcal{I} \mathcal{O}_X = 0$ and such that $p$ is
locally nilpotent on $X$.
\begin{enumerate}
\item A {\it divided power thickening of $X$ relative to
$(S, \mathcal{I}, \gamma)$} is given by a divided power thickening
$(U, T, \delta)$ over $(S, \mathcal{I}, \gamma)$
and an $S$-morphism $U \to X$.
\item A {\it morphism of divided power thickenings of $X$
relative to $(S, \mathcal{I}, \gamma)$} is defined in the obvious
manner.
\end{enumerate}
The category of divided power thickenings of $X$ relative to
$(S, \mathcal{I}, \gamma)$ is denoted $\text{CRIS}(X/S, \mathcal{I}, \gamma)$
or simply $\text{CRIS}(X/S)$.
\end{definition}

\noindent
For any $(U, T, \delta)$ in $\text{CRIS}(X/S)$
we have that $p$ is locally nilpotent on $T$, see discussion after
Definition \ref{definition-divided-power-thickening}.
There is a canonical forgetful functor
\begin{equation}
\label{equation-forget}
\text{CRIS}(X/S) \longrightarrow \Sch/X,\quad
(U, T, \delta) \longmapsto U
\end{equation}
as well as its left inverse
\begin{equation}
\label{equation-endow-trivial}
\Sch/X \longrightarrow \text{CRIS}(X/S),\quad
U \longmapsto (U, U, \emptyset)
\end{equation}
which is sometimes useful.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-divided-power-thickening-fibre-products}
With notation and assumptions as in
Definition \ref{definition-divided-power-thickening-X}.
The category $\text{CRIS}(X/S)$ has all finite nonempty limits,
in particular products of pairs and fibre products.
The functor (\ref{equation-forget}) commutes with limits.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Omitted. Hint: See Lemma \ref{lemma-affine-thickenings-colimits}
for the affine case.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-divided-power-thickening-base-change-flat}
With notation and assumptions as in
Definition \ref{definition-divided-power-thickening-X}.
Let
$$
\xymatrix{
(U_3, T_3, \delta_3) \ar[d] \ar[r] & (U_2, T_2, \delta_2) \ar[d] \\
(U_1, T_1, \delta_1) \ar[r] & (U, T, \delta)
}
$$
be a fibre square in the category of divided power thickenings of
$X$ relative to $(S, \mathcal{I}, \gamma)$. If $T_2 \to T$ is
flat, then $T_3 = T_1 \times_T T_2$ (as schemes).
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
This is true because a divided power structure extends uniquely
along a flat ring map. See Lemma \ref{lemma-gamma-extends}.
\end{proof}

\noindent
The lemma above means that the base change of a flat morphism
of divided power thickenings is another flat morphism, and in
fact is the ``usual'' base change of the morphism. This implies
that the following definition makes sense.

\begin{definition}
\label{definition-big-crystalline-site}
Assumptions and notation as in
Definition \ref{definition-divided-power-thickening-X}.
\begin{enumerate}
\item A family of morphisms $\{(U_i, T_i, \delta_i) \to (U, T, \delta)\}$
of divided power thickenings of $X/S$ is a {\it Zariski, \'etale, smooth,
syntomic, or fppf covering} if and only if the family of morphisms
of schemes $\{T_i \to T \}$ is one.
\item The {\it big crystalline site} of $X$ over $(S, \mathcal{I}, \gamma)$,
is the category $\text{CRIS}(X/S)$ endowed with the Zariski topology.
\item The topos of sheaves on $\text{CRIS}(X/S)$ is denoted
$(X/S)_{\text{CRIS}}$ or sometimes
$(X/S, \mathcal{I}, \gamma)_{\text{CRIS}}$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

\noindent
Since (\ref{equation-forget}) commutes with products and fibre
products, we see that looking at those $(U, T, \delta)$ such that
$U \to X$ is an open immersion defines a full
subcategory preserved under fibre products (and more generally
finite nonempty limits). Hence the following
definition makes sense.

\begin{definition}
\label{definition-big-crystalline-site}
Assumptions and notation as in
Definition \ref{definition-divided-power-thickening-X}.
\begin{enumerate}
\item The (small) {\it crystalline site} of $X$ over
$(S, \mathcal{I}, \gamma)$, denoted $\text{Cris}(X/S, \mathcal{I}, \gamma)$
or simply $\text{Cris}(X/S)$ is the full subcategory of $\text{CRIS}(X/S)$
consisting of those divided power thickenings such that $U \to X$ is an open
immersion. It comes endowed with the Zariski topology.
\item The topos of sheaves on $\text{Cris}(X/S)$ is denoted
$(X/S)_{\text{cris}}$ or sometimes
$(X/S, \mathcal{I}, \gamma)_{\text{cris}}$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

\noindent
We can compare the small and big crystalline sites, just like
we can compare the small and big \'etale sites of a scheme.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-compare-big-small}
The inclusion functor $\text{Cris}(X/S) \to \text{CRIS}(X/S)$ is
commutes with finite nonempty limits, is fully faithful, continuous,
and cocontinuous. There are morphisms of topoi
$$
(X/S)_{\text{cris}} \xrightarrow{i} (X/S)_{\text{CRIS}}
\xrightarrow{\pi} (X/S)_{\text{cris}}
$$
whose composition is the identity and of which the first is induced
by the inclusion functor. Moreover, $\pi_* = i^{-1}$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
For the first assertion see
Lemma \ref{lemma-divided-power-thickening-fibre-products}.
This gives us a morphism of topoi
$i : (X/S)_{\text{cris}} \to (X/S)_{\text{CRIS}}$ and a left adjoint
$i_!$ such that $i^{-1}i_! = i^{-1}i_* = \text{id}$, see
Sites, Lemmas \ref{sites-lemma-when-shriek},
\ref{sites-lemma-preserve-equalizers}, and
\ref{sites-lemma-back-and-forth}.
We claim that $i_!$ is exact. If this is true, then we can define
$\pi$ by the rules $\pi^{-1} = i_!$ and $\pi_* = i^{-1}$
and everything is clear. To prove the claim, note that we already know
that $i_!$ is right exact and preserves fibre products (see references
given). Hence it suffices to show that $i_! * = *$ where $*$ indicates
the final object in the category of sheaves of sets. 
To see this it suffices to produce a set of objects
$(U_i, T_i, \delta_i)$, $i \in I$ of $\text{Cris}(X/S)$ such that
$$
\coprod\nolimits_{i \in I} h_{(U_i, T_i, \delta_i)} \to *
$$
is surjective in $(X/S)_{\text{CRIS}}$ (details omitted).
In the affine case this
follows from Lemma \ref{lemma-set-generators}. We omit the proof
in general.
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}[Functoriality]
\label{remark-functoriality-cris}
Let $(S, I, \gamma)$ be a divided power scheme. Let $f : X \to Y$ be
a morphism of schemes over $S$ such that
$\mathcal{I} \cdot \mathcal{O}_X = 0$ and
$\mathcal{I} \cdot \mathcal{O}_Y = 0$.
Then we get a cocontinuous functor
$$
\text{CRIS}(X/S) \longrightarrow \text{CRIS}(Y/S)
$$
by letting $(U, T, \delta)$ correspond to $(U, T, \delta)$
with $U \to X \to Y$ as the $S$-morphism from $U$ to $Y$.
Hence we get a morphism of topoi
$$
f_{\text{CRIS}} : (X/S)_{\text{CRIS}} \longrightarrow (Y/S)_{\text{CRIS}}
$$
see Sites, Section \ref{sites-section-cocontinuous-morphism-topoi}.
(This is the miracle of cocontinuous functors.) By analogy with
Topologies, Lemma \ref{topologies-lemma-morphism-big-small} we define
$$
f_{\text{cris}} : (X/S)_{\text{cris}} \longrightarrow (Y/S)_{\text{cris}}
$$
by the formula $f_{\text{cris}} = \pi_Y \circ f_{\text{CRIS}} \circ i_X$
where $i_X$ and $\pi_Y$ are as in Lemma \ref{lemma-compare-big-small}
for $X$ and $Y$.
\end{remark}


\section{Crystals in finite locally free modules}
\label{section-crystals}

\noindent
Of course you can define crystals in much greater generality.

\begin{enumerate}
\item First discuss $\mathcal{O}$-modules $\mathcal{F}$.
\item Discuss the canonical connection
$\nabla : \mathcal{F} \to \mathcal{F} \otimes \Omega$
on the crystalline site.
\item Briefly discuss quasi-coherent modules.
\item Introduce crystals $=$ crystals in finite locally free modules.
\item Discuss the equivalence of the category of crystals with the
category of modules with integrable, topologically quasi-nilpotent
connection in the affine case. (Uses the divided power envelope for the
first time...?)
\end{enumerate}






\section{Cohomology of crystals}
\label{section-cohomology}

\noindent
In this section we compare crystalline cohomology with de Rham
cohomology. We follow \cite{Bhatt}.

\begin{enumerate}
\item The main theorem in the affine case.
\item The main theorem in the global case.
\end{enumerate}
