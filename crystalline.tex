\section{Introduction}
\label{section-introduction}

\noindent
This chapter is based on a lecture series given by Johan de Jong
held in 2012 at Columbia University.
The goals of this chapter are to give a quick introduction to
crystalline cohomology. A reference is the book \cite{Berthelot}.





\section{Divided powers}
\label{section-divided-powers}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Define triples $(A, I, \gamma)$. Call them {\it divided power rings}.
\item Define homomorphisms of divided power rings.
\item Remarks: $\gamma_p$ is enough $+$ nilideal.
\item OK, so consider the category of divided power rings $(A, I, \gamma)$.
I claim this has all limits and all colimits.
Empty limit: zero ring (that's weird but we need it).
Products: Exactly what you think they should be.
Equalizers: As in rings.
Empty colimit: $\mathbf{Z}$ with PD-ideal $(0)$.
General Colimits. Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a category and let
$c \mapsto (A_c, I_c, \gamma_c)$ be a diagram. Consider the functor
$$
F(B, J, \delta) = \lim_{c \in \mathcal{C}}
Hom((A_c, I_c, \gamma_c), (B, J, \delta))
$$
Note that any $f = (f_c)_{c \in C} \in F(B, J, \delta)$ has the property
that all the images $f_c(A_c)$ generate a subring $B'$ of $B$ of bounded
cardinality $\kappa$ and that all the images $f_c(I_c)$ generate a
divided power sub ideal $J'$ of $B'$. And we get a factorization of
$f$ as a $f'$ in $F(B')$ followed by the inclusion $B' \to B$.
Hence we see that $F(B, J, \delta)$ can be computed if we know the value
of $F$ on divided power rings of
cardinality $\kappa$ or less. Consider a set of objects $U$ of
dividing power rings containing an object isomorphic to every
$(B, J, \delta)$ of cardinality
at most $\kappa$. Then
$$
\lim_{(B, J, \delta) \in U, f \in F(B, J, \delta)} (B, J, \delta)
$$
will be the colimit we wanted to construct.
\item Universal divided power algebras.
\item The diagonal and the module of differentials. Important!
\item We probably don't need this, but here it is.
Berthelot's compatibility condition (weaker than homomorphism
of divided power rings): given $(A, I, \gamma) \to (B, J, \delta)$
require that $\delta$ extends to $J + IB$ compatibly with $\gamma$.
\item Given $(A, I, \gamma)$ and $\varphi : A \to B$, then $\gamma$
extends to $IB$ if one of the following conditions is satisfied:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $IB = 0$,
\item $A \to B$ is flat, or
\item $I$ is (locally) principal.
\end{enumerate}
\item Divided power algebras and flat base change... see
\cite[Proposition 2.1.7]{dJ-crystalline}. Used for closed immersions
and crystals...
\end{enumerate}





\section{Crystalline site}
\label{section-site}

\noindent
We can use either the big site or the small site.
There is also a syntomic site (sometimes useful).

\begin{enumerate}
\item Talk about divided power thickenings $(S, T, \gamma)$.
\item To simplify work over an affine base $(A, I, \gamma)$?
Always denote the base $\Sigma = \Spec(A)$.
\item Get around compatibility by looking only at $X$ lying over
$V(I)$?
\item Introduce $\text{Cris}(X/\Sigma, I, \gamma)$ and
$\text{CRIS}(X/\Sigma, I, \gamma)$.
\item Talk about fibre products and products in these sites.
Talk about coverings. Talk about sheaves.
\item Functoriality of crystalline topos? This is a bit tricky...
Probably should go later.
\end{enumerate}






\section{Crystals in finite locally free modules}
\label{section-crystals}

\noindent
Of course you can define crystals in much greater generality.

\begin{enumerate}
\item First discuss $\mathcal{O}$-modules $\mathcal{F}$.
\item Discuss the canonical connection
$\nabla : \mathcal{F} \to \mathcal{F} \otimes \Omega$
on the crystalline site.
\item Briefly discuss quasi-coherent modules.
\item Introduce crystals $=$ crystals in finite locally free modules.
\item Discuss the equivalence of the category of crystals with the
category of modules with integrable, topologically quasi-nilpotent
connection in the affine case. (Uses the divided power envelope for the
first time...?)
\end{enumerate}






\section{Cohomology of crystals}
\label{section-cohomology}

\noindent
In this section we compare crystalline cohomology with de Rham
cohomology. We follow \cite{Bhatt}.

\begin{enumerate}
\item The main theorem in the affine case.
\item The main theorem in the global case.
\end{enumerate}
