About
</div>

<div class="index_include">
The stacks project started in 2005. The initial idea was for it to be a <br>
collaborative web-based project with the aim of writing and introductory text <br>
about algebraic stacks. Temporarily there was a mailing list and some <br>
discussion as to how to proceed. For example, there are issues with referencing <br>
such a document, how to distribute credit, who does what, and many more. <br>
Although we have definite ideas about most of these points we would like to take <br>
a more positive approach. Namely, to simply create something and solve problems <br>
and answer questions as they come up.

<div class="index_include">
We do want to answer a few basic questions that the casual visitor may have <br>
about this project:

The stacks project is no longer an introductory text, but aims to build up <br>
enough basic algebraic geometry as foundations for algebraic stacks. This <br>
implies a good deal of theory on commutative algebra, schemes, varieties, <br>
algebraic spaces, has to be developed en route.

<td> The stacks project has a maintainer (currently A.J. de Jong) who accepts <br>
changes etc. proposed by contributors. Although everyone is encourage to <br>
participate it is not a wiki.

The stacks project is meant to be read online, and therefore we do not <br>
worry about length of the chapters, etc. Moreover, with hyperlinks it is <br>
possible to quickly browse through the chapters to find the lemmas, theorems, <br>
etc. that a given result depends on.
