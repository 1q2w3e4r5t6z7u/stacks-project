\section{Introduction}
\label{section-introduction}

\noindent
Basic topology will be explained in this document.
A reference is \cite{Engelking}.

\section{Basic notions}
\label{section-topology-basic}

\noindent
The following notions are considered basic and will not be defined,
and or proved. This does not mean they are all necessarily easy or 
well known.

\begin{enumerate}
\item $X$ is a {\it topological space},
\label{space}
\item $x\in X$ is a {\it point},
\label{point}
\item $f : X_1 \to X_2$ is {\it continuous},
\label{continuous}
\item $\mathcal{U} : X = \bigcup_i U_i$ is an {\it open covering of} $X$,
\label{covering}
\item the open covering $\mathcal{V}$ is a {\it refinement}
of the open covering $\mathcal{U}$,
\item etc.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Components}
\label{section-components}

\begin{definition}
Let $X$ be a topological space.
\begin{enumerate}
\item We say $X$ is {\it irreducible}, if $X$ is not empty, and whenever
$X = Z_1 \cup Z_2$ with $Z_i$ closed, we have $X = Z_1$ or $X = Z_2$.
\item We say $X$ is {\it Noetherian} if the descending chain condition
holds for closed subsets of $X$.
\item We say $X$ is {\it connected} if whenever $X = T_1 \sqcup T_2$
with $T_i \subset X$ open and closed, then either $T_1 = \emptyset$ or
$T_2 = \emptyset$.
\item We say $Z \subset X$ is an {\it irreducible component} of $X$
if $Z$ is a maximal irreducible subset of $X$.
\item We say $T \subset X$ is a {\it connected component} of $X$ if
$T$ is a maximal connected subset of $X$. 
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-irreducible}
Let $X$ be a topological space. If $T \subset X$ is irreducible
so is its closure in $X$. Any irreducible component of $X$ is
closed. Every point of $X$ is contained in some irreducible component
of $X$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Let $\overline{T}$ be the closure of the irreducible subset $T$.
If $\overline{T} = Z_1 \cup Z_2$ with $Z_i \subset \overline{T}$
closed, then $T = (T\cap Z_1) \cup (T \cap Z_2)$ and hence 
$T$ equals one of the two, say $T = Z_1 \cap T$. Thus clearly
$\overline{T} \subset Z_1$ as desired.

\medskip\noindent
Pick a point $x\in X$. Consider the set $A$ of irreducible subsets
$x \in T_\alpha \subset X$. Note that $A$ is nonempty since
$\{x\} \in A$. There is a partial ording on $A$ coming from
inclusion: $\alpha \leq \alpha' \Leftrightarrow T_\alpha \subset T_{\alpha'}$.
Choose a maximal totally ordered subset $A' \subset A$, and let
$T = \bigcup_{\alpha \in A'} T_\alpha$. We claim that $T$ is 
irreducible. Namely, suppose that $T =  Z_1 \cup Z_2$ is a union
of two closed subsets of $T$. For each $\alpha \in A'$ we have
either $T_\alpha \subset Z_1$ or $T_\alpha \subset Z_2$, by irreducibility
of $T_\alpha$. Suppose that for some $\alpha_0 \in A'$ we have
$T_{\alpha_0} \not\subset Z_1$ (say, if not we're done anyway).
Then, since $A'$ is totally ordered we see immediately that
$T_\alpha \subset Z_2$ for all $\alpha \in A'$. Hence $T = Z_2$. 
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-connected-components}
Let $X$ be a topological space. If $T \subset X$ is connected,
then so is its closure. Each point of $X$ is contained
in a connected component. Connected components are always closed,
but not necessarily open.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
The proof of closedness and existence is identical to that in
the proof of Lemma \ref{lemma-irreducible}. To get an example
where connected components are not open, just take 
an infinite product $\prod_{n \in \mathbf{N}} \{0,1\}$
with the product topology. This is a totally disconnected
space so connected components are singletons, which are
not open.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-Noetherian}
If $X$ is Noetherian, then any subset of $X$ with the induced
topology is Noetherian. Each irreducible component of $X$
contains a nonempty open of $X$. In addition, $X$ has finitely many
irreducible components.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Let $T \subset X$ and let $T_1 \supset T_2 \supset \ldots$
be a descending chain of closed subsets. Write $T_i = 
T \cap Z_i$ with $Z_i \subset X$ closed. Consider the descending
chain of closed subsets
$Z_1 \supset Z_1\cap Z_2 \supset Z_1 \cap Z_2 \cap Z_3 \ldots$
This stabilizes by assumption and hence the original sequence
of $T_i$ stabilizes.

\medskip\noindent
Let $A$ be the set of closed subsets of $X$ which do not
have finitely many irreducible components. Assume that
$A$ is not empty to arrive at a contradiction. 
The set $A$ is partially ordered by inclusion: $\alpha \leq \alpha'
\Leftrightarrow Z_{\alpha} \subset Z_{\alpha'}$.
By the descending chain condition we may find a 
smallest element of $A$, say $Z$. As $Z$ is not a finite
union of irreducible components, it is not irreducible.
Hence we can write $Z = Z' \cup Z''$ and both are strictly smaller
closed subsets. By construction $Z' = \bigcup Z'_i$ and
$Z'' = \bigcup Z''_j$ and hence $Z = \bigcup Z'_i \cup \bigcup Z''_j$.
After removing redundant members of this expression of $Z$
as a union of closed irreducible subsets, this will be the decomposition
of $Z$ into its irreducible components, a contradiction.
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}
\label{definition-Krull}
The {\it Krull dimension} of a topological space $X$ is
the element of $\{\infty,0,1,2,3,\ldots\}$ defined by
the formula:
$$
\sup
\{
n
\mid
\exists Z_0 \subset Z_1 \subset \ldots \subset Z_n \subset X,\ 
Z_i\text{ closed irreducible, }Z_i \not=Z_{i+1}
\}.
$$
\end{definition}

\begin{example}
\label{example-Krull-Rn}
The Krull dimension of the usual Euclidean space
$\mathbf{R}^n$ is $0$.
\end{example}


\section{quasi-compact maps and constructible sets}
\label{section-quasi-compact}

\noindent
The phrase ``compact'' will be reserved
for Hausdorff topological spaces. And many spaces occuring
in algebraic geometry are not Hausdorff.

\begin{definition}
\label{definition-quasi-compact}
\begin{enumerate}
\item We say that a topological space $X$ is {\it quasi-compact}
if every open covering $\mathcal{U}$ of $X$ has a finite
refinement.
\item We say that a continuous map $f : X \to Y$ is {\it quasi-compact}
if the inverse image of every quasi-compact open $V \subset Y$
the inverse image $f^{-1}(V)$ is quasi-compact.
\item We say a subset $Z \subset X$ is {\it retrocompact}
if the inclusion map $Z \to X$ is quasi-compact.
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
\label{definition-constructible}
A subset $E \subset X$ of the topological space $X$ is called
{\it constructible} if it is a finite union of subsets
of the form $U \cap V^c$ where $U,V \subset X$ are open and
retrocompact.
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-constructible}
The collection of constructible sets is closed under
finite intersections, finite unions and complements.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Complements are clear, and finite unions are clear.
For unions it suffices to show that if $U, U'$ are
open and retrocomapct, then so is $U \cap U'$.
This is immediate from the definitions.
\end{proof}


\section{Sheaves}
\label{section-sheaves}

\noindent
This part will be superceded by the discussion of sheaves
over sites later in the documents. But perhaps it makes 
sense to briefly define some of the notions here.

\begin{definition}
\label{definition-presheaf}
Let $X$ be a topological space.
A {\it presheaf} $\mathcal{F}$ of sets is a rule which
assigns to each open $U \subset X$ a set $\mathcal{F}(U)$ and
to each inclusion $V \subset U$ a map
$\rho^U_V : \mathcal{F}(U) \to \mathcal{F}(V)$ such that
whenever $W \subset V \subset U$ we have 
$\rho^U_W = \rho^V_W \circ \rho ^U_V$.
\end{definition}

\noindent
The elements of the set $\mathcal{F}(U)$ are called
the {\it sections} of $\mathcal{F}$ over $U$.
For every $V \subset U$ the map
$\rho^U_V : \mathcal{F}(U) \to \mathcal{F}(V)$
is called the {\it restricton map}. We will use the
notation $s|_V := \rho^U_V(s)$ if $s\in \mathcal{F}(U)$.
This notation is consistent with the notion of restriction
of functions from topology because if $W \subset V \subset U$
and $s$ is a section of $\mathcal{F}$ over $U$ then
$s|_W = (s|_V)|_W$ by the property of the restriction maps
expressed in the definition above.

\begin{definition}
\label{definition-sheaf}
Let $X$ be a topological space.
A {\it sheaf} $\mathcal{F}$ of sets on $X$ is a presheaf
which satsifies the following additional property: Given
any open covering $U = \bigcup U_i$ and any collection
of sections $s_i \in \mathcal{F}(U_i)$ such that
$s_i|_{U_i \cap U_j} = s_j|_{U_i \cap U_j}$ there exists
a unique section $s \in \mathcal{F}(U)$ such that
$s_i = s|_U$.
\end{definition}

\noindent
Later we will define sheaves of groups, abelian groups,
rings, modules, etc.

\begin{remark}
There is always a bit of confusion as to whether it is
necessary to say something about the set of section of
a sheaf over the empty set $\emptyset \subset X$.
Note that the empty set is
covered by the empty open covering, and hence the ``collection
of section $s_i$'' from the definition above actually form
an element of the empty product which is the final object
of the category the sheaf has values in. In other words,
if you read the definition right you automatically deduce
that $\mathcal{F}(\emptyset) = \textit{a final object}$,
which in the case of a sheaf of sets is a singleton.
\end{remark}

\subsection{Stalks}
\label{subsection-stalks}

\noindent
Let $x$ be a point and let $\mathcal{F}$ be a presheaf.
The stalk of $\mathcal{F}$ at $x$ is the set
$$
\mathcal{F}_x
=
\text{colim}_{x\in U} \mathcal{F}(U)
$$
where the colimit is over the set of opens $U \subset X$
containing $x$ (partially) ordered by inclusion, with
transition maps given by the restriction maps of $\mathcal{F}$.
See Categories, Subsubsection \ref{categories-subsubsection-posets-limits}
for notation and terminology. In other words
$$
\mathcal{F}_x
=
\{
(U,s)
\mid
x\in U, s\in \mathcal{F}(U)
\}/\sim
$$
with equivalence relation given by $(U,s) \sim (U', s')$
if and only if $s|_{U\cap U'} = s'|_{U\cap U'}$.
