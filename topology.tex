\section{Introduction}
\label{section-introduction}

\noindent
Basic topology will be explained in this document.
A reference is \cite{Engelking}.

\section{Basic notions}
\label{section-topology-basic}

\noindent
The following notions are considered basic and will not be defined,
and or proved. This does not mean they are all necessarily easy or 
well known.

\begin{enumerate}
\item $X$ is a {\it topological space},
\label{space}
\item $x\in X$ is a {\it point},
\label{point}
\item $f : X_1 \to X_2$ is {\it continuous},
\label{continuous}
\item $\mathcal{U} : X = \bigcup_i U_i$ is an {\it open covering of} $X$,
\label{covering}
\item the open covering $\mathcal{V}$ is a {\it refinement}
of the open covering $\mathcal{U}$,
\item etc.
\end{enumerate}

\section{quasi-compact maps and constructible sets}
\label{section-quasi-compact}

\noindent
The phrase ``compact'' will be reserved
for Hausdorff topological spaces. And many spaces occuring
in algebraic geometry are not Hausdorff.

\begin{definition}
\label{definition-quasi-compact}
\begin{enumerate}
\item We say that a topological space $X$ is {\it quasi-compact}
if every open covering $\mathcal{U}$ of $X$ has a finite
refinement.
\item We say that a continuous map $f : X \to Y$ is {\it quasi-compact}
if the inverse image of every quasi-compact open $V \subset Y$
the inverse image $f^{-1}(V)$ is quasi-compact.
\item We say a subset $Z \subset X$ is {\it retrocompact}
if the inclusion map $Z \to X$ is quasi-compact.
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
\label{definition-constructible}
A subset $E \subset X$ of the topological space $X$ is called
{\it constructible} if it is a finite union of subsets
of the form $U \cap V^c$ where $U,V \subset X$ are open and
retrocompact.
\end{definition}

\section{Sheaves}
\label{section-sheaves}

\noindent
This part will be superceded by the discussion of sheaves
over sites later in the documents. But perhaps it makes 
sense to briefly define some of the notions here.

\begin{definition}
\label{definition-presheaf}
Let $X$ be a topological space.
A {\it presheaf} $\mathcal{F}$ of sets is a rule which
assigns to each open $U \subset X$ a set $\mathcal{F}(U)$ and
to each inclusion $V \subset U$ a map
$\rho^U_V : \mathcal{F}(U) \to \mathcal{F}(V)$ such that
whenever $W \subset V \subset U$ we have 
$\rho^U_W = \rho^V_W \circ \rho ^U_V$.
\end{definition}

\noindent
The elements of the set $\mathcal{F}(U)$ are called
the {\it sections} of $\mathcal{F}$ over $U$.
For every $V \subset U$ the map
$\rho^U_V : \mathcal{F}(U) \to \mathcal{F}(V)$
is called the {\it restricton map}. We will use the
notation $s|_V := \rho^U_V(s)$ if $s\in \mathcal{F}(U)$.
This notation is consistent with the notion of restriction
of functions from topology because if $W \subset V \subset U$
and $s$ is a section of $\mathcal{F}$ over $U$ then
$s|_W = (s|_V)|_W$ by the property of the restriction maps
expressed in the definition above.

\begin{definition}
\label{definition-sheaf}
Let $X$ be a topological space.
A {\it sheaf} $\mathcal{F}$ of sets on $X$ is a presheaf
which satsifies the following additional property: Given
any open covering $U = \bigcup U_i$ and any collection
of sections $s_i \in \mathcal{F}(U_i)$ such that
$s_i|_{U_i \cap U_j} = s_j|_{U_i \cap U_j}$ there exists
a unique section $s \in \mathcal{F}(U)$ such that
$s_i = s|_U$.
\end{definition}

\noindent
Later we will define sheaves of groups, abelian groups,
rings, modules, etc.

\begin{remark}
There is always a bit of confusion as to whether it is
necessary to say something about the set of section of
a sheaf over the empty set $\emptyset \subset X$.
Note that the empty set is
covered by the empty open covering, and hence the ``collection
of section $s_i$'' from the definition above actually form
an element of the empty product which is the final object
of the category the sheaf has values in. In other words,
if you read the definition right you automatically deduce
that $\mathcal{F}(\emptyset) = \textit{a final object}$,
which in the case of a sheaf of sets is a singleton.
\end{remark}

\subsection{Stalks}
\label{subsection-stalks}

\noindent
Let $x$ be a point and let $\mathcal{F}$ be a presheaf.
The stalk of $\mathcal{F}$ at $x$ is the set
$$
\mathcal{F}_x
=
\text{colim}_{x\in U} \mathcal{F}(U)
$$
where the colimit is over the set of opens $U \subset X$
containing $x$ (partially) ordered by inclusion, with
transition maps given by the restriction maps of $\mathcal{F}$.
See Categories, Subsubsection \ref{categories-subsubsection-posets-limits}
for notation and terminology. In other words
$$
\mathcal{F}_x
=
\{
(U,s)
\mid
x\in U, s\in \mathcal{F}(U)
\}/\sim
$$
with equivalence relation given by $(U,s) \sim (U', s')$
if and only if $s|_{U\cap U'} = s'|_{U\cap U'}$.
