\section{Introduction}
\label{section-introduction}

\noindent
Basic topology will be explained in this document.
A reference is \cite{Engelking}.

\section{Basic notions}
\label{section-topology-basic}

\noindent
The following notions are considered basic and will not be defined,
and or proved. This does not mean they are all necessarily easy or 
well known.

\begin{enumerate}
\item $X$ is a {\it topological space},
\label{space}
\item $x\in X$ is a {\it point},
\label{point}
\item $f : X_1 \to X_2$ is {\it continuous},
\label{continuous}
\item $\mathcal{U} : X = \bigcup_i U_i$ is an {\it open covering of} $X$,
\label{covering}
\item the open covering $\mathcal{V}$ is a {\it refinement}
of the open covering $\mathcal{U}$,
\label{refinement}
\item a topological space $X$ is {\it Hausdorff} iff for every
distinct pair of points $x, y \in X$ there exist disjoint
opens $U, V \subset X$ such that $x \in U$, $y \in V$,
\label{Hausdorff}
\item etc.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Components}
\label{section-components}

\begin{definition}
\label{definition-components}
Let $X$ be a topological space.
\begin{enumerate}
\item We say $X$ is {\it irreducible}, if $X$ is not empty, and whenever
$X = Z_1 \cup Z_2$ with $Z_i$ closed, we have $X = Z_1$ or $X = Z_2$.
\item We say $X$ is {\it Noetherian} if the descending chain condition
holds for closed subsets of $X$.
\item We say $X$ is {\it connected} if whenever $X = T_1 \sqcup T_2$
with $T_i \subset X$ open and closed, then either $T_1 = \emptyset$ or
$T_2 = \emptyset$.
\item We say $Z \subset X$ is an {\it irreducible component} of $X$
if $Z$ is a maximal irreducible subset of $X$.
\item We say $T \subset X$ is a {\it connected component} of $X$ if
$T$ is a maximal connected subset of $X$. 
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-irreducible}
Let $X$ be a topological space. If $T \subset X$ is irreducible
so is its closure in $X$. Any irreducible component of $X$ is
closed. Every point of $X$ is contained in some irreducible component
of $X$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Let $\overline{T}$ be the closure of the irreducible subset $T$.
If $\overline{T} = Z_1 \cup Z_2$ with $Z_i \subset \overline{T}$
closed, then $T = (T\cap Z_1) \cup (T \cap Z_2)$ and hence 
$T$ equals one of the two, say $T = Z_1 \cap T$. Thus clearly
$\overline{T} \subset Z_1$ as desired.

\medskip\noindent
Pick a point $x\in X$. Consider the set $A$ of irreducible subsets
$x \in T_\alpha \subset X$. Note that $A$ is nonempty since
$\{x\} \in A$. There is a partial ording on $A$ coming from
inclusion: $\alpha \leq \alpha' \Leftrightarrow T_\alpha \subset T_{\alpha'}$.
Choose a maximal totally ordered subset $A' \subset A$, and let
$T = \bigcup_{\alpha \in A'} T_\alpha$. We claim that $T$ is 
irreducible. Namely, suppose that $T =  Z_1 \cup Z_2$ is a union
of two closed subsets of $T$. For each $\alpha \in A'$ we have
either $T_\alpha \subset Z_1$ or $T_\alpha \subset Z_2$, by irreducibility
of $T_\alpha$. Suppose that for some $\alpha_0 \in A'$ we have
$T_{\alpha_0} \not\subset Z_1$ (say, if not we're done anyway).
Then, since $A'$ is totally ordered we see immediately that
$T_\alpha \subset Z_2$ for all $\alpha \in A'$. Hence $T = Z_2$. 
\end{proof}

\noindent
A singleton is irreducible. Thus if $x \in X$ is a point
then the closure $\overline{\{x\}}$ is an irreducible closed
subset of $X$. 

\begin{definition}
\label{definition-generic-point}
Let $X$ be a topological space.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Let $Z \subset X$ be an irreducible closed subset.
A {\it generic point} of $Z$ is a point $\xi \in Z$ such
that $Z = \overline{\{\xi\}}$.
\item The space $X$ is called {\it sober} if every
irreducible closed subset has a unique generic point.
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

\begin{example}
\label{example-Hausdorff}
Recall that a topological space $X$ is Hausdorff iff for every
distinct pair of points $x, y \in X$ there exist disjoint
opens $U, V \subset X$ such that $x \in U$, $y \in V$.
In this case $X$ is irreducible if and only if $X$ is
a singleton. Similarly, any subset of $X$ is irreducible
if and only if it is a singleton. Hence a Hausdorff space is
sober.
\end{example}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-connected-components}
Let $X$ be a topological space. If $T \subset X$ is connected,
then so is its closure. Each point of $X$ is contained
in a connected component. Connected components are always closed,
but not necessarily open.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
The proof of closedness and existence is identical to that in
the proof of Lemma \ref{lemma-irreducible}. To get an example
where connected components are not open, just take 
an infinite product $\prod_{n \in \mathbf{N}} \{0,1\}$
with the product topology. This is a totally disconnected
space so connected components are singletons, which are
not open.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-Noetherian}
If $X$ is Noetherian, then any subset of $X$ with the induced
topology is Noetherian. Each irreducible component of $X$
contains a nonempty open of $X$. In addition, $X$ has finitely many
irreducible components.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Let $T \subset X$ and let $T_1 \supset T_2 \supset \ldots$
be a descending chain of closed subsets. Write $T_i = 
T \cap Z_i$ with $Z_i \subset X$ closed. Consider the descending
chain of closed subsets
$Z_1 \supset Z_1\cap Z_2 \supset Z_1 \cap Z_2 \cap Z_3 \ldots$
This stabilizes by assumption and hence the original sequence
of $T_i$ stabilizes.

\medskip\noindent
Let $A$ be the set of closed subsets of $X$ which do not
have finitely many irreducible components. Assume that
$A$ is not empty to arrive at a contradiction. 
The set $A$ is partially ordered by inclusion: $\alpha \leq \alpha'
\Leftrightarrow Z_{\alpha} \subset Z_{\alpha'}$.
By the descending chain condition we may find a 
smallest element of $A$, say $Z$. As $Z$ is not a finite
union of irreducible components, it is not irreducible.
Hence we can write $Z = Z' \cup Z''$ and both are strictly smaller
closed subsets. By construction $Z' = \bigcup Z'_i$ and
$Z'' = \bigcup Z''_j$ and hence $Z = \bigcup Z'_i \cup \bigcup Z''_j$.
After removing redundant members of this expression of $Z$
as a union of closed irreducible subsets, this will be the decomposition
of $Z$ into its irreducible components, a contradiction.
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}
\label{definition-Krull}
The {\it Krull dimension} $\dim(X)$ of a topological space $X$ is
the element of $\{\infty,0,1,2,3,\ldots\}$ defined by
the formula:
$$
\sup
\{
n
\mid
\exists Z_0 \subset Z_1 \subset \ldots \subset Z_n \subset X,\ 
Z_i\text{ closed irreducible, }Z_i \not=Z_{i+1}
\}.
$$
Let $x \in X$.
The {\it Krull dimension of $X$ at $x$} is defined as the infinum
of $\dim(U)$ where $U$ runs over the open neighbourhoods of $x$
in $X$.
\end{definition}

\begin{example}
\label{example-Krull-Rn}
The Krull dimension of the usual Euclidean space
$\mathbf{R}^n$ is $0$.
\end{example}


\section{quasi-compact maps and constructible sets}
\label{section-quasi-compact}

\noindent
The phrase ``compact'' will be reserved
for Hausdorff topological spaces. And many spaces occuring
in algebraic geometry are not Hausdorff.

\begin{definition}
\label{definition-quasi-compact}
\begin{enumerate}
\item We say that a topological space $X$ is {\it quasi-compact}
if every open covering $\mathcal{U}$ of $X$ has a finite
refinement.
\item We say that a continuous map $f : X \to Y$ is {\it quasi-compact}
if the inverse image of every quasi-compact open $V \subset Y$
the inverse image $f^{-1}(V)$ is quasi-compact.
\item We say a subset $Z \subset X$ is {\it retrocompact}
if the inclusion map $Z \to X$ is quasi-compact.
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
\label{definition-constructible}
A subset $E \subset X$ of the topological space $X$ is called
{\it constructible} if it is a finite union of subsets
of the form $U \cap V^c$ where $U,V \subset X$ are open and
retrocompact.
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-constructible}
The collection of constructible sets is closed under
finite intersections, finite unions and complements.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Complements are clear, and finite unions are clear.
For unions it suffices to show that if $U, U'$ are
open and retrocomapct, then so is $U \cap U'$.
This is immediate from the definitions.
\end{proof}


\section{Sheaves}
\label{section-sheaves}

\noindent
This part will be superceded by the discussion of sheaves
over sites later in the documents. But perhaps it makes 
sense to briefly define some of the notions here.

\subsection{Presheaves}
\label{subsection-presheaves}

\begin{definition}
\label{definition-presheaf}
Let $X$ be a topological space.
\begin{enumerate}
\item A {\it presheaf} $\mathcal{F}$ of sets is a rule which
assigns to each open $U \subset X$ a set $\mathcal{F}(U)$ and
to each inclusion $V \subset U$ a map
$\rho^U_V : \mathcal{F}(U) \to \mathcal{F}(V)$ such that
whenever $W \subset V \subset U$ we have 
$\rho^U_W = \rho^V_W \circ \rho ^U_V$.
\item A morphism $\varphi : \mathcal{F} \to \mathcal{G}$ 
of presheaves of sets is a rule which assigns to each
open $U \subset X$ a map of sets $\varphi : \mathcal{F}(U)
\to \mathcal{G}(U)$ compatible with restriction maps,
i.e., whenever $V \subset U \subset X$ are open the
diagram
$$
\xymatrix{
\mathcal{F}(U) \ar[r]^\varphi \ar[d]^{\rho^U_V} &
\mathcal{G}(U) \ar[d]^{\rho^U_V} \cr
\mathcal{F}(V) \ar[r]^\varphi & \mathcal{G}(V)
}
$$
commutes.
\item The category of presheaves of sets on $X$ will be denoted
$\textit{PSh}(X)$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

\noindent
The elements of the set $\mathcal{F}(U)$ are called
the {\it sections} of $\mathcal{F}$ over $U$.
For every $V \subset U$ the map
$\rho^U_V : \mathcal{F}(U) \to \mathcal{F}(V)$
is called the {\it restricton map}. We will use the
notation $s|_V := \rho^U_V(s)$ if $s\in \mathcal{F}(U)$.
This notation is consistent with the notion of restriction
of functions from topology because if $W \subset V \subset U$
and $s$ is a section of $\mathcal{F}$ over $U$ then
$s|_W = (s|_V)|_W$ by the property of the restriction maps
expressed in the definition above.

\subsection{Presheaves of abelian groups, etc}
\label{subsection-abelian-presheaves}

\noindent
In this section we briefly point out some features of the
category of presheaves that allow one to define presheaves
of abelian groups, rings, etc. Of course it would be better
to discuss this in greater generality, using that limits
and colimts exist in the category of presheaves of sets,
but we leave this to our later discussion of (pre)sheaves
on a general site.

\begin{example}
\label{example-singleton-presheaf}
Let $X$ be a topological space $X$. Consider a rule $\mathcal{F}$ that
associates to every open subset a singleton set. Since every set
has a unique map into a singleton set, there exist unique restriction
maps $\rho^U_V$. The resulting structure is a presheaf of sets.
It is a final object in the category of presehaves of sets, by the
property of singleton sets mentioned above. Hence it is
also unique up to unique isomorphism. We will sometimes write $*$
for this presheaf.
\end{example}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-product-presheaves}
The category of presheaves of sets has products
(see Categories, Definition \ref{categories-definition-product}).
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Namely, suppose $\mathcal{F}$ and $\mathcal{G}$ are
presheaves of sets on the topological space $X$.
Consider the rule $U \mapsto \mathcal{F}(U) \times \mathcal{G}(U)$,
denoted $\mathcal{F}\times \mathcal{G}$. If $V \subset U \subset X$
are open then define the restriction mapping
$$
(\mathcal{F} \times \mathcal{G})(U)
\longrightarrow
(\mathcal{F} \times \mathcal{G})(V)
$$
by mapping $(s, t) \mapsto (s|_V, t|_V)$. Then it is immediately
clear that $\mathcal{F}\times\mathcal{G}$ is a presheaf.
Also, there are projection maps
$p : \mathcal{F}\times\mathcal{G} \to \mathcal{F}$
and 
$q : \mathcal{F}\times\mathcal{G} \to \mathcal{G}$.
We leave it to the reader to show that
for any third presheaf $\mathcal{H}$ we have
$\text{Mor}(\mathcal{H}, \mathcal{F}\times \mathcal{G})
= \text{Mor}(\mathcal{H}, \mathcal{F}) \times
\text{Mor}(\mathcal{H}, \mathcal{G})$.
\end{proof}

\noindent
Recall that if $(A, + : A\times A \to A, - : A \to A, 0\in A)$
is an abelian group, then the zero and the negation maps are
uniquely determined by the addition law. In other words, it
makes sense to say ``let $(A, +)$ be an abelian group''.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-abelian-presheaves}
Let $X$ be a topological space.
Let $\mathcal{F}$ be a presheaf of sets.
Consider the following types of structure on $\mathcal{F}$:
\begin{enumerate}
\item For every open $U$ the structure of an abelian group
on $\mathcal{F}(U)$ such that all restriction maps are
abelian group homomorphisms.
\item A map of presheaves
$+ : \mathcal{F} \times \mathcal{F} \to \mathcal{F}$,
a map of presheaves $- : \mathcal{F} \to \mathcal{F}$
and a map $0 : * \to \mathcal{F}$
(see Example \ref{example-singleton-presheaf})
satisfying all the axioms of $+, -, 0$ in a usual
abelian group.
\item A map of presheaves
$+ : \mathcal{F} \times \mathcal{F} \to \mathcal{F}$,
a map of presheaves $- : \mathcal{F} \to \mathcal{F}$
and a map $0 : * \to \mathcal{F}$
such that for each open $U \subset X$ the quadruple
$(\mathcal{F}(U), +, -, 0)$ is an abelian group,
\item A map of presheaves $+ : \mathcal{F} \times \mathcal{F}
\to \mathcal{F}$ such that for every open $U \subset X$
the map $+ : \mathcal{F}(U) \times \mathcal{F}(U) \to \mathcal{F}(U)$
defines the structure of an abelian group.
\end{enumerate}
There are natural bijections between the collections of
types of data (1) - (3) above.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Omitted.
\end{proof}

\noindent
The lemma says that to give an abelian group object $\mathcal{F}$
in the category of presheaves is the same as giving a presheaf of sets
$\mathcal{F}$ such that all the sets $\mathcal{F}(U)$ are endowed
with the structure of an abelian group and such that all the restriction
mappings are group homomorphisms. For most algebra structures
we will take this approach to (pre)sheaves of such objects, i.e.,
we will define a (pre)sheaf of such objects to be a (pre)sheaf
$\mathcal{F}$ of sets all of whose sets of sections $\mathcal{F}(U)$
are endowed with this structure compatibly with the restriction
mappings.

\begin{definition}
\label{definition-abelian-presheaves}
Let $X$ be a topological space.
\begin{enumerate}
\item A {\it presheaf of abelian groups} or an {\it abelian presheaf}
is a presheaf of sets $\mathcal{F}$ endowed with one of the types
of structures mentioned in Lemma \ref{lemma-abelian-presheaves} above.
\item A {\it morphism of presheaves of abelian groups}
$\varphi : \mathcal{F} \to \mathcal{G}$ is a morphism of presheaves
of sets which induces
a homomorphism of abelian groups $\mathcal{F}(U) \to \mathcal{G}(U)$
for every open $U \subset X$.
\item The category of presheaves of abelian groups on $X$ is denoted
$\textit{PAb}(X)$.
\item {\it Presheaves of (not necessarily abelian) groups, rings, modules
over a fixed ring, vector spaces over a fixed field,} etc and
{\it morphisms between these} are defined similarly (see remark
above the definition).
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
\label{remark-presheaves-structure}
This remark intends to clarify the definition
of presheaves of certain types of structures,
but is likely very confusing for those reading
this material for the first time.
Suppose that $\mathcal{C}$ is a category and
that $F : \mathcal{C} \to \textit{Sets}$ is
a faithfull functor. Typically $F$ is a ``forgetfull''
functor. Then we may define a ``presheaf of objects of $\mathcal{C}$''
as a pair consisting of
\begin{enumerate}
\item a presheaf of sets $\mathcal{F}$, and
\item for every open $U \subset X$ a choice
of an object $A(U) \in \text{Ob}(\mathcal{C})$
\end{enumerate}
such that
\begin{enumerate}
\item we have $F(A(U)) = \mathcal{F}(U)$ for all $U \subset X$ open, and
\item for every $V \subset U \subset X$ open we have
$\rho^U_V : F(A(U)) = \mathcal{F}(U) \to F(A(V)) = \mathcal{F}(V)$
is in the image of $F : \text{Mor}_{\mathcal{C}}(A(U), A(V))
\to \text{Map}(\mathcal{F}(U), \mathcal{F}(V))$.
\end{enumerate}
In other words, the restriction mappings $\rho^U_V$ actually
come from unique morphisms $A(U) \to A(V)$ in the category $\mathcal{C}$.
It should be clear to the observant reader that $U \mapsto A(U)$
is a contravariant functor from the category of opens of $X$
into $\mathcal{C}$. This is the notion we will use later on
(in the section on sites).
\end{remark}

\subsection{Sheaves}
\label{subsection-sheaves}

\noindent
In this section we explain the sheaf condition.

\begin{definition}
\label{definition-sheaf}
Let $X$ be a topological space.
\begin{enumerate}
\item A {\it sheaf} $\mathcal{F}$ of sets on $X$ is a presheaf
which satsifies the following additional property: Given
any open covering $U = \bigcup_{i \in I} U_i$ and any collection
of sections $s_i \in \mathcal{F}(U_i)$, $i \in I$ such that
$\forall i,j\in I$
$$
s_i|_{U_i \cap U_j} = s_j|_{U_i \cap U_j}
$$
there exists a unique section $s \in \mathcal{F}(U)$ such that
$s_i = s|_U$ for all $i \in I$.
\item A {\it morphism of sheaves of sets} is simply a
morphism of presheaves of sets.
\item The category of sheaves of sets on $X$ is denoted
$\textit{Sh}(X)$.
\item {\it Sheaves of groups, rings, modules
over a fixed ring, vector spaces over a fixed field,} etc
are defined to be presheaves of groups, rings, modules over
a fixed ring, vector spaces over a fixed field, etc such
that the underlying presheaf of sets is a sheaf%
\footnote{This only for those categories of algebraic
structures listed here. See Remark \ref{remark-sheaves-structure}}.
\item The category of sheaves of abelian groups
is denoted $\textit{Ab}(X)$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
There is always a bit of confusion as to whether it is
necessary to say something about the set of section of
a sheaf over the empty set $\emptyset \subset X$.
Note that the empty set is
covered by the empty open covering, and hence the ``collection
of section $s_i$'' from the definition above actually form
an element of the empty product which is the final object
of the category the sheaf has values in. In other words,
if you read the definition right you automatically deduce
that $\mathcal{F}(\emptyset) = \textit{a final object}$,
which in the case of a sheaf of sets is a singleton.
\end{remark}

\begin{example}
\label{example-basic-continuous-maps}
Let $X$, $Y$ be topological spaces.
Consider the rule $\mathcal{F}$ wich associates to
the open $U \subset X$ the set
$$
\mathcal{F}(U) = \{ f : U \to Y \mid f \text{ is continuous}\}
$$
with the obvious restriction mappings. We claim that
$\mathcal{F}$ is a sheaf. To see this suppose that
$U = \bigcup_{i\in I} U_i$ is an open covering, and
$f_i \in \mathcal{F}(U_i)$, $i\in I$ with
$f_i |_{U_i \cap U_j} = f_j|_{U_i \cap U_j}$ for all $i,j \in I$.
In this case define $f : U \to Y$ by setting $f(u)$
equal to the value of $f_i(u)$ for any $i \in I$ such that
$u \in U_i$. This is well defined by assumption. Moreover,
$f : U \to Y$ is a map such that its restriction to $U_i$
agrees with the continuous map $U_i$. Hence clearly $f$ is
continuous!
\end{example}

\begin{remark}
\label{remark-sheaves-structure}
This remark intends to clarify the definition
of sheaves of certain types of structures,
but is likely very confusing for those reading
this material for the first time; it is a continuation
of Remark \ref{remark-presheaves-structure}.
Suppose that $\mathcal{C}$ is a category and
that $F : \mathcal{C} \to \textit{Sets}$ is
a faithfull functor. Then we have defined
in Remark \ref{remark-presheaves-structure}
the notion of a presheaf of objects of $\mathcal{C}$
(in terms of a presheaf of sets $\mathcal{F}$ and
object $A(U)$, etc).
When does Definition \ref{definition-sheaf} give
the ``correct notion'' of a sheaf? According to
our later definitions (see Sites, Section \ref{sites-section-sheaves}),
if $\mathcal{C}$ has all products, then this should imply that
for every open covering $U = \bigcup_{i \in I} U_i$, the
sequence
$$
\xymatrix{
A(U) \ar[r]
&
\prod\nolimits_{i\in I}
A(U_i)
\ar@<1ex>[r] \ar@<-1ex>[r]
&
\prod\nolimits_{(i_0, i_1) \in I\times I}
A(U_{i_0} \cap U_{i_1})
}
$$
is an equalizer diagram {\it in the category $\mathcal{C}$}.
But in the definition above we only require the
corresponding diagram of sets to be an equalizer diagram!
A small amount of thought shows the definition above {\it does work} if
the category $\mathcal{C}$ and
the functor $F : \mathcal{C} \to \textit{Sets}$
have the following properties:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\mathcal{C}$ has products and equalizers,
\item the functor $F$ commutes with products,
\item the functor $F$ commutes with equalizers, and
\item the functor $F$ reflects isomorphisms.
\end{enumerate}
The last property means that given a morphism
$f : A \to A'$ in $\mathcal{C}$, then $f$ is
an isomorphism if (and only if) $F(f)$ is.
Below you will find an example where Definition \ref{definition-sheaf}
does not lead to the correct notion.
\end{remark}

\begin{example}
\label{example-sheaves-topological-spaces}
Sheaves of topological spaces should not be defined as
in Definition \ref{definition-sheaf}.
This example is confusing and should probably be skipped on
a first reading. Suppose $X = \mathbf{N}$ with the discrete
topology. Let $A_i$, for $i \in \mathbf{N}$ be a discrete
topological space. For any subset $U \subset \mathbf{N}$
define $\mathcal{F}(U) = \prod_{i\in U} A_i$ with the
discrete topology. Then this is a presheaf of topological
spaces whose underlying presheaf of sets is a sheaf.
However, if each $A_i$ has at least two elements, then
this is not a sheaf of topological spaces
according to Sites, Definition \ref{sites-definition-sheaf}.
The reader may check that putting the product topology on
each $\mathcal{F}(U) = \prod_{i\in U} A_i$ does lead to a sheaf
of topological spaces over $X$.
\end{example}






\subsection{Stalks}
\label{subsection-stalks}

\noindent
Let $x$ be a point and let $\mathcal{F}$ be a presheaf.
The stalk of $\mathcal{F}$ at $x$ is the set
$$
\mathcal{F}_x
=
\text{colim}_{x\in U} \mathcal{F}(U)
$$
where the colimit is over the set of opens $U \subset X$
containing $x$ (partially) ordered by inclusion, with
transition maps given by the restriction maps of $\mathcal{F}$.
See Categories, Subsection \ref{categories-subsection-posets-limits}
for notation and terminology. In other words
$$
\mathcal{F}_x
=
\{
(U,s)
\mid
x\in U, s\in \mathcal{F}(U)
\}/\sim
$$
with equivalence relation given by $(U,s) \sim (U', s')$
if and only if $s|_{U\cap U'} = s'|_{U\cap U'}$.

\subsection{Sheafification}
\label{subsection-sheafification}

\noindent
In this subsection we explain how to get the sheafification
of a presheaf on a topological space. We will use stalks
to describe the sheafification in this case. This is different
from the general procedure described in Sites, Section
\ref{sites-section-sheafification}, and perhaps somewhat
easier to understand.
