In this document we define schemes.

\section{Locally ringed spaces}
\label{section-locally-ringed-spaces}

\noindent
Recall that we defined ringed spaces
in Sheaves, Section \ref{sheaves-section-ringed-spaces}.
Briefly, a ringed space is a pair $(X, \mathcal{O}_X)$ consisting
of a topological space $X$ and a sheaf of rings $\mathcal{O}_X$.
A morphism of ringed spaces $f : (X, \mathcal{O}_X) \to (Y, \mathcal{O}_Y)$
is given by a continuous map $f : X \to Y$ and an $f$-map of sheaves
of rings $f^\sharp : \mathcal{O}_Y \to \mathcal{O}_X$. You can
think of $f^\sharp$ as a map $\mathcal{O}_Y \to f_*\mathcal{O}_X$, see
Sheaves, Definition \ref{sheaves-definition-f-map} and Lemma
\ref{sheaves-lemma-f-map}.

\medskip\noindent
A good geometric example of this to keep in mind is
$\mathcal{C}^\infty$-manifolds and morphisms of
$\mathcal{C}^\infty$-manifolds. Namely, if $M$ is a
$\mathcal{C}^\infty$-manifold, then the sheaf $\mathcal{C}^\infty_M$
of smooth functions is a sheaf of rings on $M$. And any
map $f : M \to N$ of manifolds is smooth if and only if
for every local section $h$ of $\mathcal{C}^\infty_N$
the composition $h \circ f$ is a local section of $\mathcal{C}^\infty_M$.
Thus a smooth map $f$ gives rise in a natural way to a morphism
of ringed spaces
$$
f : (M , \mathcal{C}^\infty_M) \longrightarrow (N, \mathcal{C}^\infty_N)
$$
see Sheaves, Example \ref{sheaves-example-continuous-map-ringed}.
It is instructive to consider what happens to stalks. Namely, let
$m \in M$ with image $f(m) = n \in N$. Recall that the stalk
$\mathcal{C}^\infty_{M,m}$ is the ring of germs of smooth
functions at $m$, see
Sheaves, Example \ref{sheaves-example-germs-functions}.
The algebra of germs of functions on $(M,m)$ is a local ring with maximal
ideal the functions which vanish at $m$.
Similarly for $\mathcal{C}^\infty_{N,n}$. The map on stalks
$f^\sharp : \mathcal{C}^\infty_{N,n} \to \mathcal{C}^\infty_{M,m}$
maps the maximal ideal into the maximal ideal, simply
because $f(m) = n$.

\medskip\noindent
In algebraic geometry we study schemes. On a scheme the sheaf of rings
is not determined by an intrinsic property of the space.
The spectrum of a ring $R$
(see Algebra, Section \ref{algebra-section-spectrum-ring}) endowed
with a sheaf of rings constructed out of $R$ (see below),
will be our basic building block. It will turn out that
the stalks of $\mathcal{O}$ on $\text{Spec}(R)$ are the local
rings of $R$ at its primes. There are two reasons to introduce
locally ringed spaces in this setting: (1) There is in general
no mechanism that assigns to a continuous map of spectra a
map of the corresponding rings. This is why we add as an extra datum
the map $f^\sharp$. (2) If we consider morphisms
of these spectra in the category of ringed spaces, then the
maps on stalks may not be local homomorphisms. Since our
geometric intuition says it should we introduce locally ringed spaces
as follows.

\begin{definition}
\label{definition-locally-ringed-space}
\begin{enumerate}
\item A {\it locally ringed space $(X,\mathcal{O}_X)$}
is a pair consisting of a
topological space $X$ and a sheaf of rings $\mathcal{O}_X$ all of whose stalks
are local rings.
\item A {\it morphism of locally ringed spaces}
$(f, f^\sharp) : (X, \mathcal{O}_X) \to (Y,\mathcal{O}_Y)$
is a morphism of ringed spaces such that for all $x \in X$
the induced ring map $\mathcal{O}_{Y,f(x)} \to \mathcal{O}_{X,x}$ is a
local ring map.
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

\noindent
We will usually suppress the sheaf of rings $\mathcal{O}_X$
in the notation when discussing locally ringed spaces. We will
simply refer to ``the locally ringed space $X$''.
We will by abuse of notation think of $X$ also as
the underlying topological space. Finally we will denote
the corresponding sheaf of rings
$\mathcal{O}_X$ as the {\it structure sheaf of $X$}.
In addition, it is customary to denote the maximal ideal
of the local ring $\mathcal{O}_{X, x}$ by
$\mathfrak{m}_{X,x}$ or simply $\mathfrak{m}_x$.
We will say ``let $f : X \to Y$ be a morphism of locally ringed
spaces'' thereby surpressing the structure sheaves even further.
In this case, we will by abuse of notation think of $f : X\to Y$
also as the underlying continuous map of topological spaces.
The $f$-map corresponding to $f$ will customarily
be denoted $f^\sharp$. The condition that $f$ is a morphism
of locally ringed spaces can then be expressed by saying that
for every $x\in X$ the map on stalks
$$
f^\sharp_x : \mathcal{O}_{Y,f(x)} \longrightarrow \mathcal{O}_{X, x}
$$
maps the maximal ideal $\mathfrak m_{Y, f(x)}$ into
$\mathfrak m_{X, x}$.

\medskip\noindent
Let us use these notational conventions to show that the
collection of locally ringed spaces and morphisms of locally
ringed spaces forms a category. In order to see this we have
to show that the composition of morphisms of locally ringed
spaces is a morphism of locally ringed spaces. OK, so let
$f : X \to Y$ and $g : Y \to Z$ be morphism of locally
ringed spaces. The composition of $f$ and $g$ is defined in
Sheaves, Definition \ref{sheaves-definition-composition-maps-ringed-spaces}.
Let $x \in X$. By
Sheaves, Lemma \ref{sheaves-lemma-compose-f-maps-stalks}
the composition
$$
\mathcal{O}_{Z, g(f(x))}
\xrightarrow{g^\sharp}
\mathcal{O}_{Y, f(x)}
\xrightarrow{f^\sharp}
\mathcal{O}_{X, x}
$$
is the associated map on stalks for the morphism $g \circ f$.
The result follows since a composition of local ring
homomorphisms is a local ring homomorphism.

\medskip\noindent
A pleasing feature of the definition is the fact that the functor
$$
\textit{Locally ringed spaces}
\longrightarrow
\textit{Ringed spaces}
$$
reflects isomorphisms. Here is a less abstract statement.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-isomorphism-locally-ringed}
Let $X$, $Y$ be locally ringed spaces.
If $f : X \to Y$ is an isomorphism of
ringed spaces, then $f$ is an isomorphism
of locally ringed spaces.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
This follows trivially from the corresponding fact in algebra:
Suppose $A$, $B$ are local rings. Any isomorphism of rings
$A \to B$ is a local ring homomorphism.
\end{proof}



\section{Affine schemes}
\label{section-affine-schemes}

\noindent
Let $R$ be a ring. Consider the topological space $\text{Spec}(R)$
associated to $R$, see Algebra, Section \ref{algebra-section-spectrum-ring}.
We will endow this space with a sheaf of rings $\mathcal{O}_{\text{Spec}(R)}$
and the resulting pair $(\text{Spec}(R), \mathcal{O}_{\text{Spec}(R)})$
will be an affine scheme.

\medskip\noindent
Recall that $\text{Spec}(R)$ has a basis of open sets $D(f)$,
$f \in R$ which we call standard opens, see Algebra,
Definition \ref{algebra-definition-Zariski-topology}.
In addition, the intersection of two standard opens is another:
$D(f) \cap D(g) = D(fg)$, $f,g\in R$.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-standard-open}
Let $R$ be a ring. Let $f \in R$.
\begin{enumerate}
\item If $g\in R$ and $D(g) \subset D(f)$,
then (a) $f$ is invertible in $R_g$,
(b) $g^e = af$ for some $e \geq 1$ and $a \in R$,
(c) there is a canonical ring map $R_f \to R_g$, and (d)
there is a canonical $R_f$-module map
$M_f \to M_g$ for any $R$-module $M$.
\item Any open covering of $D(f)$ can be refined to a finite
open covering of the form $D(f) = \bigcup_{i=1}^n D(g_i)$.
\item If $g_1,\ldots,g_n \in R$, then $D(f) \subset \bigcup D(g_i)$
if and only if $g_1,\ldots,g_n$ generate the unit ideal in $R_f$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Recall that $D(g) = \text{Spec}(R_g)$ (see
Algebra, Lemma \ref{algebra-lemma-standard-open}).
Thus (a) holds because $f$
maps to an element of $R_g$ which is not
contained in any prime ideal, and hence invertible,
see Algebra, Lemma \ref{algebra-lemma-Zariski-topology}.
Write the inverse of $f$ in $R_g$ as $a/g^d$.
This means $g^d - af$ is annihilated by a power of $g$, whence (b).
For (c), the map $R_f \to R_g$ exists by (a) from the universal property
of localization, or we can define it by mapping $b/f^n$
to $a^nb/g^{ne}$. The equality $M_f = M \otimes_R R_f$
can be used to obtain the map on modules, or
we can define $M_f \to M_g$ by mapping
$x/f^n$ to $a^nx/g^{ne}$.

\medskip\noindent
Recall that $D(f)$ is quasi-compact, see 
Algebra, Lemma \ref{algebra-lemma-qc-open}.
Hence the second statement follows directly
from the fact that the standard opens form
a basis for the topology.

\medskip\noindent
The third statement follows directly from
Algebra, Lemma \ref{algebra-lemma-Zariski-topology}.
\end{proof}

\noindent
In Sheaves, Section \ref{sheaves-section-bases} we defined
the notion of a sheaf on a basis, and we showed that it is
essentially equivalent to the notion of a sheaf on the space,
see Sheaves, Lemmas \ref{sheaves-lemma-extend-off-basis} and
\ref{sheaves-lemma-extend-off-basis-structures}. Moreover,
we showed in
Sheaves, Lemma \ref{sheaves-lemma-cofinal-systems-coverings-standard-case}
that it is sufficient to check the sheaf
condition on a cofinal system of open coverings for each
standard open. By the lemma above it suffices to check
on the finite coverings by standard opens.

\begin{definition}
\label{definition-standard-covering}
Let $R$ be a ring.
\begin{enumerate}
\item A {\it standard open covering} of $\text{Spec}(R)$
is a covering $\text{Spec}(R) = \bigcup_{i=1}^n D(f_i)$,
where $f_1,\ldots, f_n \in R$.
\item Suppose that $D(f) \subset \text{Spec}(R)$ is a standard
open. A {\it standard open covering} of $D(f)$
is a covering $D(f) = \bigcup_{i=1}^n D(g_i)$,
where $g_1,\ldots, g_n \in R$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

\noindent
Let $R$ be a ring. Let $M$ be an $R$-module. We will define
a presheaf $\widetilde M$ on the basis of standard opens.
Suppose that $U \subset \text{Spec}(R)$ is a standard open.
If $f, g \in R$ are such that $D(f) = D(g)$, then
by Lemma \ref{lemma-standard-open} above there are canonical
maps $M_f \to M_g$ and $M_g \to M_f$ which are mutually inverse.
Hence we may choose any $f$ such that $U = D(f)$
and define
$$
\widetilde M(U) = M_f.
$$
Note that if $D(g) \subset D(f)$, then by
Lemma \ref{lemma-standard-open} above we have
a canonical map
$$
\widetilde M(D(f)) = M_f \longrightarrow M_g = \widetilde M(D(g)).
$$
Clearly, this defines a presheaf of abelian groups on the basis
of standard opens. If $M = R$, then $\widetilde R$ is a presheaf
of rings on the basis of standard opens.

\medskip\noindent
Let us compute the stalk of $\widetilde M$ at a point $x \in \text{Spec}(R)$.
Suppose that $x$ corresponds to the prime $\mathfrak p \subset R$.
By definition of the stalk we see that
$$
\widetilde M_x = \text{colim}_{f\in R, f\not\in \mathfrak p}\ M_f
$$
Here the set $\{f\in R, f\not\in \mathfrak p\}$ is partially
ordered by the rule $f \geq f' \Leftrightarrow D(f) \subset D(f')$.
If $f_1, f_2 \in R \setminus \mathfrak p$, then we have
$f_1f_2 \geq f_1$ in this ordering. Hence by
Algebra, Lemma \ref{algebra-lemma-localization-colimit}
we conclude that
$$
\widetilde M_x = M_{\mathfrak p}.
$$

\medskip\noindent
Next, we check the sheaf condition for the standard open coverings.
If $D(f) = \bigcup_{i=1}^n D(g_i)$, then the sheaf condition
for this covering is equivalent with the exactness of the
sequence
$$
0 \to M_f \to \bigoplus M_{g_i} \to \bigoplus M_{g_ig_j}.
$$
Note that $D(g_i) = D(fg_i)$, and hence we can rewrite this
sequence as the sequence
$$
0 \to M_f \to \bigoplus M_{fg_i} \to \bigoplus M_{fg_ig_j}.
$$
In addition, by Lemma \ref{lemma-standard-open} above
we see that $g_1,\ldots,g_n$ generate the unit ideal
in $R_f$. Thus we may apply
Algebra, Lemma \ref{algebra-lemma-cover-module}
to the module $M_f$ over $R_f$ and the elements $g_1,\ldots,g_n$.
We conclude that the sequence is exact. By the remarks
made above, we see that $\widetilde M$ is a sheaf
on the basis of standard opens.

\medskip\noindent
Thus we conclude from the material in
Sheaves, Section \ref{sheaves-section-bases}
that there exists a
unique sheaf of rings $\mathcal{O}_{\text{Spec}(R)}$
which agrees with $\widetilde R$ on the standard opens.
Note that by our computation of stalks above, the
stalks of this sheaf of rings are all local rings.

\medskip\noindent
Similarly, for any $R$-module $M$ there exists
a unique sheaf of $\mathcal{O}_{\text{Spec}(R)}$-modules
$\mathcal{F}$ which agrees with $\widetilde M$ on the
standard opens, see
Sheaves, Lemma \ref{sheaves-lemma-extend-off-basis-module}.

\begin{definition}
\label{definition-structure-sheaf}
Let $R$ be a ring.
\begin{enumerate}
\item The {\it structure sheaf $\mathcal{O}_{\text{Spec}(R)}$ of the
spectrum of $R$} is the unique sheaf of rings $\mathcal{O}_{\text{Spec}(R)}$
which agrees with $\widetilde R$ on the basis of standard opens.
\item The locally ringed space
$(\text{Spec}(R), \mathcal{O}_{\text{Spec}(R)})$ is called
the {\it spectrum} of $R$ and denoted $\text{Spec}(R)$.
\item The sheaf of $\mathcal{O}_{\text{Spec}(R)}$-modules
extending $\widetilde M$ to all opens of $\text{Spec}(R)$
is called the sheaf of $\mathcal{O}_{\text{Spec}(R)}$-modules
associated to $M$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

\noindent
We summarize the results obtained so far.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-spec-sheaves}
Let $R$ be a ring. Let $M$ be an $R$-module. Let $\mathcal{F}$
be the sheaf of $\mathcal{O}_{\text{Spec}(R)}$-modules
associated to $M$.
\begin{enumerate}
\item We have
$$
\Gamma(\text{Spec}(R), \mathcal{O}_{\text{Spec}(R)}) = R
$$
\item We have
$$
\Gamma(\text{Spec}(R), \mathcal{F}) = M
$$
as an $R$-module.
\item For every $f \in R$ we have 
$$
\Gamma(D(f), \mathcal{O}_{\text{Spec}(R)}) = R_f
$$
\item For every $f\in R$ we have
$$
\Gamma(D(f), \mathcal{F}) = M_f
$$
as an $R_f$-module.
\item Whenever $D(g) \subset D(f)$ the restriction mappings
$R_f \to R_g$ and $M_f \to M_g$ are the ones from Lemma
\ref{lemma-standard-open}.
\item Let $\mathfrak p$ be a prime of $R$, and let $x \in \text{Spec}(R)$
be the corresponding point. We have
$$
\mathcal{O}_{\text{Spec}(R), x} = R_{\mathfrak p}
$$
\item Let $\mathfrak p$ be a prime of $R$, and let $x \in \text{Spec}(R)$
be the corresponding point. We have
$$
\mathcal{F}_x = M_{\mathfrak p}
$$
as an $R_{\mathfrak p}$-module.
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Clear from the discussion above.
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}
\label{definition-affine-scheme}
An {\it affine scheme} is a locally ringed space isomorphic
as a locally ringed space to $\text{Spec}(R)$ for some ring $R$. 
A {\it morphism of affine schemes} is a morphism in the category
of locally ringed spaces.
\end{definition}

\noindent
It turns out that affine schemes play a special role
among all locally ringed spaces, which is what the next
section is about.

\section{The category of affine schemes}
\label{section-category-affine-schemes}

\noindent
Note that if $Y$ is an affine scheme, then its
points are in canonical $1-1$ bijection with
prime ideals in $\Gamma(Y, \mathcal{O}_Y)$.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-morphism-into-affine-where-point-goes}
Let $X$ be a locally ringed space.
Let $Y$ be an affine scheme.
Let $f \in \text{Mor}(X, Y)$ be a morphism
of locally ringed spaces. Given a point $x \in X$
consider the ring maps
$$
\Gamma(Y, \mathcal{O}_Y) \xrightarrow{f^\sharp}
\Gamma(X, \mathcal{O}_X) \to \mathcal{O}_{X, x}
$$
Let $\mathfrak p \subset \Gamma(Y, \mathcal{O}_Y)$ denote
the inverse image of $\mathfrak m_x$. Let $y \in Y$ be the
corresponding point. Then $f(x) = y$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Consider the commutative diagram
$$
\xymatrix{
\Gamma(X, \mathcal{O}_X) \ar[r] &
\mathcal{O}_{X, x} \\
\Gamma(Y, \mathcal{O}_Y) \ar[r] \ar[u] &
\mathcal{O}_{Y, f(x)} \ar[u]
}
$$
(see the discussion of $f$-maps below
Sheaves, Definition \ref{sheaves-definition-f-map}).
Since the right vertical arrow is local
we see that $\mathfrak m_{f(x)}$ is the
inverse image of $\mathfrak m_x$. The result
follows.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-f-open}
Let $X$ be a locally ringed space.
Let $f \in \Gamma(X, \mathcal{O}_X)$.
The set
$$
D(f) = \{x \in X \mid \text{image }f \not\in \mathfrak m_x\}
$$
is open. Moreover $f|_{D(f)}$ has an inverse.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Suppose that $U \subset X$ and $V \subset X$ are
two open subsets such that $f|_U$ has an inverse
$g$ and $f|_V$ has an inverse $h$. Then clearly
$g|_{U\cap V} = h|_{U\cap V}$. Thus it suffices
to show that $f$ is invertible in an open neighbourhood
of any $x \in D(f)$. This is clear because
$f \not \in \mathfrak m_x$ implies that $f \in \mathcal{O}_{X,x}$
has an inverse $g \in \mathcal{O}_{X,x}$ which means there
is some open neighbourhood $x \in U \subset X$ so
that $g \in \mathcal{O}_X(U)$ and $g\cdot f|_U = 1$.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-f-open-affine}
In Lemma \ref{lemma-f-open} above, if $X$ is an affine scheme,
then the open $D(f)$ agrees with the standard open $D(f)$
defined previously (in
Algebra, Definition \ref{algebra-definition-spectrum-ring}).
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Omitted.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-morphism-into-affine}
Let $X$ be a locally ringed space.
Let $Y$ be an affine scheme.
The map
$$
\text{Mor}(X, Y)
\longrightarrow
\text{Hom}(\Gamma(Y, \mathcal{O}_Y), \Gamma(X, \mathcal{O}_X))
$$
which maps $f$ to the restriction of $f^\sharp$ to global
sections is bijective.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Since $Y$ is affine we have
$(Y, \mathcal{O}_Y) \cong (\text{Spec}(R), \mathcal{O}_{\text{Spec}(R)})$
for some ring $R$.
During the proof we will use facts about $Y$ and
its structure sheaf which are direct consequences of things
we know about the spectrum of a ring, see e.g.\ Lemma
\ref{lemma-spec-sheaves}.

\medskip\noindent
Motivated by the lemmas above we construct the inverse map.
Let $\psi_Y : \Gamma(Y, \mathcal{O}_Y) \to \Gamma(X, \mathcal{O}_X)$
be a ring map. First, we define the corresponding map of
spaces
$$
\Psi : X \longrightarrow Y
$$
by the rule of
Lemma \ref{lemma-morphism-into-affine-where-point-goes}.
In other words, given $x \in X$ we define $\Psi(x)$
to be the point of $Y$ corresponding to the prime
in $\Gamma(Y, \mathcal{O}_Y)$ which is the inverse
image of $\mathfrak m_x$ under the composition
$
\Gamma(Y, \mathcal{O}_Y) \xrightarrow{\psi_Y}
\Gamma(X, \mathcal{O}_X) \to
\mathcal{O}_{X, x}
$.

\medskip\noindent
We claim that the map $\Psi : X \to Y$ is continuous.
The standard opens $D(g)$, for $g \in \Gamma(Y, \mathcal{O}_Y)$
are a basis for the toppology of $Y$. Thus it suffices to prove
that $\Psi^{-1}(D(g))$ is open. By construction of $\Psi$
the inverse image $\Psi^{-1}(D(g))$ is exactly the set
$D(\psi_Y(g)) \subset X$ which is open by Lemma \ref{lemma-f-open}.
Hence $\Psi$ is continuous.

\medskip\noindent
Next we construct a $\Psi$-map of sheaves from
$\mathcal{O}_Y$ to $\mathcal{O}_X$. By
Sheaves, Lemma \ref{sheaves-lemma-f-map-basis-below-structures}
it suffices to define ring maps
$\psi_{D(g)} : \Gamma(D(g), \mathcal{O}_Y) \to
\Gamma(\Psi^{-1}(D(g)), \mathcal{O}_X)$
compatible with restriction maps.
We have a canonical isomorphism
$\Gamma(D(g), \mathcal{O}_Y) = \Gamma(Y, \mathcal{O}_Y)_g$,
because $Y$ is an affine scheme.
Because $\psi_Y(g)$ is invertible on $D(\psi_Y(g))$
we see that there is a canonical map
$$
\Gamma(Y, \mathcal{O}_Y)_g
\longrightarrow
\Gamma(\Psi^{-1}(D(g)), \mathcal{O}_X)
=
\Gamma(D(\psi_Y(g)), \mathcal{O}_X) 
$$
extending the map $\psi_Y$
by the universal property of localization.
Note that there is no choice but to take the canonical map here!
And we take this, combined
with the canonical identification
$\Gamma(D(g), \mathcal{O}_Y) = \Gamma(Y, \mathcal{O}_Y)_g$, to
be $\psi_{D(g)}$. This is compatible with localization since the
restriction mapping on the affine schemes are defined in terms
of the universal properties of localization also, see
Lemmas \ref{lemma-spec-sheaves} and \ref{lemma-standard-open}.

\medskip\noindent
Thus we have defined a morphism of ringed spaces
$(\Psi, \psi) : (X, \mathcal{O}_X) \to (Y, \mathcal{O}_Y)$
recovering $\psi_Y$ on global sections. To see that it is
a morphism of locally ringed spaces we have to show that
the induced maps on local rings
$$
\psi_x : \mathcal{O}_{Y,\Psi(x)} \longrightarrow \mathcal{O}_{X, x}
$$
are local. This follows immediately from the commutative diagram
of the proof of Lemma \ref{lemma-morphism-into-affine-where-point-goes}
and the definition of $\Psi$.

\medskip\noindent
Finally, we have to show that the constructions
$(\Psi, \psi) \mapsto \psi_Y$ and the construction
$\psi_Y \mapsto (\Psi, \psi)$ are inverse to each other.
Clearly, $\psi_Y \mapsto (\Psi, \psi) \mapsto \psi_Y$.
Hence the only thing to prove is that given $\psi_Y$
there is at most one pair $(\Psi, \psi)$ giving rise
to it. The uniqueness of $\Psi$ was shown in Lemma
\ref{lemma-morphism-into-affine-where-point-goes} and
given the uniqueness of $\Psi$ the uniqueness of the
map $\psi$ was pointed out during the course of the proof
above.
\end{proof}


\section{Sets of affine schemes}
\label{section-sets-of-affines}

\noindent
Choose an ordinal $\alpha$ and denote $\text{Aff}_\alpha$ the
category of affine schemes which are elements of $V_\alpha$, see
Sets, Section \ref{sets-section-sets-hierarchy}. So there is a
theory of algebraic stacks for any $\alpha$. There are some minimal
conditions on $\alpha$ needed to imply that $\text{Aff}_\alpha$ is a site. 
These minimal required properties are expressed in the following lemma.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-Aff-site}
For any set $S$ may choose an ordinal $\alpha$ with $S \in V_\alpha$ 
such that $\text{Aff}_\alpha$ has (finite) fibre products, and finite disjoint
unions. In addition we may assume that for any finitely presented morphism
of affines $X \to Y$, such that $Y \in \text{Aff}_\alpha$, there exists
an affine $X' \in \text{Ob}(\text{Aff}_\alpha)$ such that $X' \cong X$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Consider the following statement: ``For any finite directed graph $\Gamma$,
for any assignment $v \mapsto F(v)$, $\forall v\in \text{Vertices}(\Gamma)$,
where $F(v)$ is an affine scheme, and any assignment
$\big(e : v_1 \to v_2\big) \mapsto \big(F(e) : F(v_1) \to F(v_2)\big)$,
$\forall e \in \text{Edges}(\Gamma)$ where $F(e)$ is a morphism of affine
schemes, there exists an affine scheme $X$ and morphisms $f(v) : X \to F(v)$,
$\forall v\in \text{Vertices}(\Gamma)$ such that $f(v_2) = F(e) \circ f(v_1)$,
$\forall \big(e : v_1 \to v_2\big) \in \text{Edges}(\Gamma)$, such that
$(X, \{f(v)\}_{v\in \text{Vertices}(\Gamma)})$ is universal among all such.''
This statement says that finite limits exist for affine schemes. It is
proved in a standard way (for example by turning it into ring theory).

\medskip\noindent
On the other hand, upon formalizing the statement we obtain a provable
formula $\phi(\Gamma, F)$ of ZFC set theory. Hence, according to the reflection
principle, see Sets, Lemma \ref{sets-section-reflection-principle}
there exists an ordinal $\alpha$ such that the formula is true in
$V_\alpha$: If you take $\Gamma \in V_\alpha$ and the $F(v)$ to be in
$\text{Aff}_\alpha$, then you can find a solution
$(X, \{f(v)\}_{v\in \text{Vertices}(\Gamma)})$
with $X$ in $V_\alpha$. This takes care of the statement about fibre 
products. (Of course as soon as $\alpha$ is infinite then every
graph is isomorphic to a graph in $V_\alpha$; we can also simply apriori
require this for $V_\alpha$.).

\medskip\noindent
We can similarly write out the condition of the existence of disjoint unions
as a set theory formula, and similarly the existence of the affine $X'$
given $X \to Y$. The reflection principle states we can have $S$ inside of
$V_\alpha$ as well.
\end{proof}

\noindent
Clearly, we may assume that $\text{Aff}_\alpha$ is closed under any reasonable
operation (see Sets, Section \ref{sets-section-reflection-principle}).
Of course, whenever we require such a condition we will need to write out
the proof that this is so.

\medskip\noindent
So, in the following we will work with stacks (or categories) over
$\text{Aff}_\alpha$\footnote{As per our general philosophy, if we ever need
an actual 2-category of stacks, we also choose another cardinal $\gamma$ and
consider only those categories over $\text{Aff}_\alpha$ contained in
$V_\gamma$.}. If $\alpha < \beta$, then there is an inclusion
$\text{Aff}_\alpha \subset \text{Aff}_\beta$, and hence any category
over $\text{Aff}_\beta$ gives rise to a category over $\text{Aff}_\alpha$.
But this is not the correct thing to do when studying algebraic stacks.
Instead we want to show that algebraic stacks over $\text{Aff}_\alpha$
give rise to algebraic stacks over $\text{Aff}_\beta$. In other words we will
need a theorem saying that the 2-category of algebraic
stacks over $\text{Aff}_\alpha$ is equivalent to a full sub-2-category of
algebraic stacks over $\text{Aff}_\beta$. Here it is.

\medskip\noindent
FIXME. Improve the theorem below and move it to a more appropriate spot.

\begin{theorem}
\label{theorem-change-alpha}
Suppose that $p : \mathcal{S} \to \text{Aff}_\alpha$ is an algebraic stack.
Let $\beta > \alpha$. Then there exists an algebraic stack
$p' : \mathcal{S}' \to \text{Aff}_\beta$ and an equivalence
$$
\xymatrix{
(p')^{-1}(\text{Aff}_\alpha) \ar[rd]_{p'} \ar[rr]^c && \mathcal{S}\ar[ld]^p\\
&\text{Aff}_\alpha.&}
$$
The pair $((\mathcal{S'},p'),c)$ is well determined up to a 1-isomorphism
(which is itself unique up to unique 2-isomorphism).
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
FIXME. Hint. Choose a representation (in $\text{Stacks}/\text{Aff}_\alpha$)
$\mathcal{S} = [ \mathcal{X}/\mathcal{R} ]$, with $\mathcal{X}$ representable
by a scheme $X$ and $\mathcal{R}$ representable by an algebraic space.
Choose a presentation $\mathcal{R} = [ \mathcal{U}/\mathcal{R}_\mathcal{U} ]$
where $\mathcal{U}$ and $\mathcal{R}_\mathcal{U}$ are representable
by schemes $U$ and $R_U$. Now define (in $\text{Stacks}/\text{Aff}_\beta$)
$\mathcal{U}'$ to be the stack associated to $U$, $\mathcal{R}'_\mathcal{U}$
to be the stack associated to $R_U$, $\mathcal{R}'$ the stack
$\mathcal{R}' = [ \mathcal{U}'/\mathcal{R}'_\mathcal{U} ]$, $\mathcal{X}'$
the stack associated to $X$, and finally
$\mathcal{S}' = [ \mathcal{X}'/\mathcal{R}' ]$.
\end{proof}

\noindent
From now on $\text{Aff}$ will denote a category of affines $\text{Aff}_\alpha$
such as in Lemma \ref{lemma-Aff-site}. By the theorem above we may increase
$\alpha$ whenever this is needed.

\begin{remark}
\label{remark-other-approach}
There is another approach. Allow yourself to enlarge $\alpha$ at any moment.
Think of every statement in the text as being preceded by ``There exist
arbitrarily large $\alpha$ such that''. 
\end{remark}

\section{Schemes}
\label{section-schemes}

\noindent
We recall the definition of a scheme.

\medskip\noindent
A scheme $(X,\mathcal{O}_X)$ is a locally ringed space
with the property that every point has a neighbourhood which is an
affine scheme.

\medskip\noindent
A scheme $X$ gives rise to a functor (or presheaf)
$$
\xymatrix{
\text{Aff}^{\text{opp}} \ar[r]^{h_X} & \text{Sets}, &
U \ar@{|->}[r] & \text{Mor}(U, X).}
$$
The usual Yoneda lemma tells us that we can recover the scheme from this
functor. 

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-yoneda-schemes}
Suppose that $X$, $Y$ are schemes with that have open coverings
by affines isomorphic to objects of $\text{Aff}$. Then $\text{Mor}(X,Y)
= \text{Mor}(h_X, h_Y)$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
FIXME.
\end{proof}

\section{Stacks representable by a scheme}
\label{section-stack-representable-by-scheme}

\noindent
In Categories, Definition
\ref{categories-definition-representable-fibred-category} we
defined the notion of a representable category fibred in groupoids. This,
applied to a stack (or a category) over $\text{Aff}$ will define the notion of
a stack representable by an affine scheme. 

\medskip\noindent
Here is the formal definition of a category over $\text{Aff}$ representable by
a scheme. Please also see the informal discussion below.

\begin{definition}
\label{definition-representable-by-scheme}
A category fibred in groupoids $p : \mathcal{S} \to \text{Aff}$ is
called representable by a scheme, if the following conditions are satisfied:
\begin{enumerate}
\item all fibre categories $\mathcal{S}_U$ are setlike, and
\item the presheaf $U \mapsto \text{Ob}(\mathcal{S}_U)/\cong$ is 
is isomorphic to $h_S$ for a scheme $S$ as in
Lemma \ref{lemma-yoneda-schemes}.
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-representable-by-scheme-implies-stack}
If $\mathcal{S} \to \text{Aff}$ is representable by a scheme then $\mathcal{S}$
is a stack over $\text{Aff}$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
FIXME.
\end{proof}

\begin{example}
\label{example-standard-representable-scheme}
Let $X$ be a scheme that has a covering by open affines which are isomorphic
to objects of $\text{Aff}$. There is a standard stack over $\text{Aff}$
representable by $X$, namely the stack of affines over $X$. Compare
Categories, Example \ref {categories-example-comma-category}.
This stack will be denoted $\text{Aff}/X$, and it is described as follows.
\begin{enumerate}
\item An object of $\text{Aff}/X$ is a morphism of schemes
$U \to X$, with $U \in \text{Ob}(\text{Aff})$.
\item A morphism between $U\to X$ and $V \to X$ is a commutative diagram
$$
\xymatrix{
U \ar[rr] \ar[rd] && V \ar[ld] \\
&X.&}
$$
\item The functor $(\text{Aff}/X) \to \text{Aff}$ maps $U\to X$ to $U$.
\end{enumerate}
It is clear from the definition that $\text{Aff}/X$ is representable by
a scheme. 

\medskip\noindent
The construction is clearly functorial in $X$, so that a morphism
of schemes $f : X \to Y$ induces a morphisms of stacks 
$\text{Aff}/X \to \text{Aff}/Y$. FIXME: more?
\end{example}

\begin{situation}
\label{situation-stack-represented-by-scheme}
The following situation will appear repeatedly in the text. Suppose that
$\mathcal{S} \to \text{Aff}$ is a stack representable by a scheme. If we
say the scheme $S$ represents $\mathcal{S}$, then we mean that besides 
being given the scheme $S$, we are given an equivalence $j : \mathcal{S}
\to \text{Aff}/S$ of stacks over $\text{Aff}$.
\end{situation}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-morphism-stacks-representable-by-schemes}
Suppose that the stacks $\mathcal{X}$, $\mathcal{Y}$ are represented
by the schemes $X$ and $Y$. For any morphism of stacks $F : \mathcal{X}
\to \mathcal{Y}$ there is a unique morphism of schemes $f : X \to Y$
such that the diagram
$$
\xymatrix{
\mathcal{X} \ar[r]^F \ar[d]_j & \mathcal{Y} \ar[d]^j \\
\text{Aff}/X \ar[r]^f & \text{Aff}/Y}
$$
2-commutes and then the diagram actually commutes.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
FIXME.
\end{proof}

\section{Morphisms representable by schemes}
\label{section-morphisms-representable-by-schemes}

\noindent
In this section we define the notion of moprhisms of stacks over $\text{Aff}$
representable by schemes.

\section{Definition}
\label{section-definition-representable-by-schemes}

\noindent
Here is the formal definition. Please also see the informal discussion below.

\begin{definition}
\label{definition-representable-by-schemes}
Let $f : \mathcal{X} \to \mathcal{Y}$ be a morphism of categories
fibred in groupoids over $\text{Aff}$. We say $f$ is representable by
schemes if for every stack $\mathcal{S}$ representable by a scheme
(see Definition \ref{definition-representable-by-scheme}), and every morphism
$\mathcal{U} \to \mathcal{Y}$, the 2-fibre product
$\mathcal{S}\times_\mathcal{Y}\mathcal{X}$ is representable by a scheme.
\end{definition}

\noindent
Informal discussion. In the situation of the definition we sometimes 
say that $\mathcal{X}$ is relatively representable over $\mathcal{Y}$.
Suppose that, with the notation of the definition, $S$ represents
$\mathcal{S}$ and $W$ represents $\mathcal{S}\times_\mathcal{Y}\mathcal{X}$.
According to Lemma \ref{lemma-morphism-stacks-representable-by-schemes}
we get a morphism of schemes $g : W \to S$ and a 2-commutative diagram
of stacks
$$
\xymatrix{
\text{Aff}/W \ar[d]^g &
\mathcal{S}\times_\mathcal{X}\mathcal{Y} \ar[d] \ar[l]^j \ar[r] &
\mathcal{Y} \ar[d] \\
\text{Aff}/S &
\mathcal{S} \ar[l]^j \ar[r] & \mathcal{X}
}
$$
FIXME: more.

\medskip\noindent
FIXME. It seems to me that you can define the notion even if 
$\mathcal{X}$ and $\mathcal{Y}$ are just categories over $\text{Aff}$. Does
it make sense in this generality?

\begin{definition}
\label{definition-property-morphism-representable-by-schemes}
Let $P$ be a property of morphisms of schemes such that
if the morphism $f : X \to Y$ has property $P$, then so does
every base change of $f$. (FIXME: introduce base change.)
We say that a morphism of stacks $\mathcal{X}
\to \mathcal{Y}$ representable by schemes has property
$P$ if for every diagram as above the morphism of schemes
$g : W \to S$ has property $P$.
\end{definition}

\noindent
FIXME. Explain rationale behind this definition: what else could it be?
