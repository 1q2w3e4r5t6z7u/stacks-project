\section{Introduction}
\label{section-introduction}

\noindent
In the chapter on topologies on algebraic spaces (see
Topologies on Spaces, Section \ref{spaces-topologies-section-introduction})
we introduced etale, fppf, smooth, syntomic and fpqc coverings of
algebraic spaces.
In this chapter we discuss what kind of structures over algebraic spaces
can be descended through such coverings.
See for example \cite{Gr-I}, \cite{Gr-II}, \cite{Gr-III},
\cite{Gr-IV}, \cite{Gr-V}, and \cite{Gr-VI}.



\section{Conventions}
\label{section-conventions}

\noindent
The standing assumption is that all schemes are contained in
a big fppf site $\textit{Sch}_{fppf}$. And all rings $A$ considered
have the property that $\text{Spec}(A)$ is (isomorphic) to an
object of this big site.

\medskip\noindent
Let $S$ be a scheme and let $X$ be an algebraic space over $S$.
In this chapter and the following we will write $X \times_S X$
for the product of $X$ with itself (in the category of algebraic
spaces over $S$), instead of $X \times X$.













\section{Descending properties of morphisms}
\label{section-descending-properties-morphisms}

\noindent
In this section we introduce the notion of when a property of morphisms of
algebraic spaces is local on the target in a topology. Please compare with
Descent, Section \ref{descent-section-descending-properties-morphisms}.

\begin{definition}
\label{definition-property-morphisms-local}
Let $S$ be a scheme.
Let $\mathcal{P}$ be a property of morphisms of algebraic spaces over $S$.
Let $\tau \in \{fpqc, fppf, syntomic, smooth, etale\}$.
We say $\mathcal{P}$ is {\it $\tau$ local on the base}, or
{\it $\tau$ local on the target}, or
{\it local on the base for the $\tau$-topology} if for any
$\tau$-covering $\{Y_i \to Y\}_{i \in I}$ of algebraic spaces
and any morphism of algebraic spaces $f : X \to Y$ we 
have
$$
f \text{ has }\mathcal{P}
\Leftrightarrow
\text{each }Y_i \times_Y X \to Y_i\text{ has }\mathcal{P}.
$$
\end{definition}

\noindent
It is probably best to only consider this notion for properties of morphisms
which are already known to be stable under arbitrary base change (since it is
easy to forget to check the direct implication).

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-descending-properties-morphisms}
Let $S$ be a scheme. Let $\mathcal{P}$ be a property of morphisms of
algebraic spaces over $S$. Assume
\begin{enumerate}
\item if $X_i \to Y_i$, $i = 1, 2$ have property $\mathcal{P}$ so
does $X_1 \amalg X_2 \to Y_1 \amalg Y_2$,
\item a morphism of algebraic spaces $f : X \to Y$ has property
$\mathcal{P}$ if and only if for every affine scheme $Z$ and
morphism $Z \to Y$ the base change $Z \times_Y X \to Z$ of $f$
has property $\mathcal{P}$, and
\item for any surjective flat morphism of affine schemes
$Z' \to Z$ over $S$ and a morphism $f : X \to Z$ from an algebraic space
to $Z$ we have
$$
f' : Z' \times_Z X \to Z'\text{ has }\mathcal{P}
\Rightarrow
f\text{ has }\mathcal{P}.
$$
\end{enumerate}
Then $\mathcal{P}$ is fpqc local on the base.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
If $\mathcal{P}$ has property (2), then it is automatically
stable under any base change. Hence the direct implication in
Definition \ref{definition-property-morphisms-local}.

\medskip\noindent
Let $\{Y_i \to Y\}_{i \in I}$ be an fpqc covering of algebraic spaces over $S$.
Let $f : X \to Y$ be a morphism of algebraic spaces over $S$.
Assume each base change $f_i : Y_i \times_Y X \to Y_i$ has property
$\mathcal{P}$. Our goal is to show that $f$ has $\mathcal{P}$.
Let $Z$ be an affine scheme, and let $Z \to Y$ be a morphism.
By (2) it suffices to show that the morphism of algebraic spaces
$Z \times_Y X \to Z$ has $\mathcal{P}$.
Since $\{Y_i \to Y\}_{i \in I}$ is an fpqc covering we know there
exists a standard fpqc covering $\{Z_j \to Z\}_{j = 1, \ldots , n}$
and morphisms $Z_j \to Y_{i_j}$ over $Y$ for suitable indices $i_j \in I$.
Since $f_{i_j}$ has $\mathcal{P}$ we see that
$$
Z_j \times_Y X
=
Z_j \times_{Y_{i_j}} (Y_{i_j} \times_Y X)
\longrightarrow
Z_j
$$
has $\mathcal{P}$ as a base change of $f_{i_j}$ (see first remark of the
proof). Set $Z' = \coprod_{j = 1, \ldots, n} Z_j$, so that $Z' \to Z$ is
a flat and surjective morphism of affine schemes over $S$. By (1)
we conclude that $Z' \times_Y X \to Z'$ has property $\mathcal{P}$.
Since this is the base change of the morphism $Z \times_Y X \to Z$
by the morphism $Z' \to Z$ we conclude that
$Z \times_Y X \to Z$ has property $\mathcal{P}$ as desired.
\end{proof}


\section{Descending properties of morphisms in the fpqc topology}
\label{section-descending-properties-morphisms-fpqc}


\noindent
In this section we find a large number of properties
of morphisms of algebraic spaces which are local on the base
in the fpqc topology. Please compare with
Descent, Section \ref{descent-section-descending-properties-morphisms-fpqc}
for the case of morphisms of schemes.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-descending-property-quasi-compact}
Let $S$ be a scheme.
The property $\mathcal{P}(f) =$``$f$ is quasi-compact''
is fpqc local on the base on algebraic spaces over $S$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
We will use
Lemma \ref{lemma-descending-properties-morphisms}
to prove this. Assumptions (1) and (2) of that lemma follow from
Morphisms of Spaces,
Lemma \ref{spaces-morphisms-lemma-quasi-compact-local}.
Let $Z' \to Z$ be a surjective flat morphism of affine schemes over $S$.
Let $f : X \to Z$ be a morphism of algebraic spaces, and assume
that the base change $f' : Z' \times_Z X \to Z'$ is quasi-compact. We have
to show that $f$ is quasi-compact. To see this, using
Morphisms of Spaces,
Lemma \ref{spaces-morphisms-lemma-quasi-compact-local}
again, it is enough to show that for every affine scheme $Y$ and
morphism $Y \to Z$ the fibre product $Y \times_Z X$ is quasi-compact.
Here is a picture:
\begin{equation}
\label{equation-cube}
\vcenter{
\xymatrix{
Y \times_Z Z' \times_Z X \ar[dd] \ar[rr] \ar[rd] &&
Z' \times_Z X \ar'[d][dd]^{f'} \ar[rd] \\
& Y \times_Z X \ar[dd] \ar[rr] && X \ar[dd]^f \\
Y \times_Z Z' \ar'[r][rr] \ar[rd] && Z' \ar[rd] \\
& Y \ar[rr] && Z
}
}
\end{equation}
Note that all squares are cartesian and the bottom square consists
of affine schemes. The assumption that $f'$ is quasi-compact combined with
the fact that $Y \times_Z Z'$ is affine implies that
$Y \times_Z Z' \times_Z X$ is quasi-compact. Since
$$
Y \times_Z Z' \times_Z X \longrightarrow Y \times_Z X
$$
is surjective as a base change of $Z' \to Z$
we conclude that $Y \times_Z X$ is quasi-compact, see
Morphisms of Spaces,
Lemma \ref{spaces-morphisms-lemma-surjection-from-quasi-compact}.
This finishes the proof.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-descending-property-quasi-separated}
Let $S$ be a scheme.
The property $\mathcal{P}(f) =$``$f$ is quasi-separated''
is fpqc local on the base on algebraic spaces over $S$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
A base change of a quasi-separated morphism is quasi-separated, see
Morphisms of Spaces,
Lemma \ref{spaces-morphisms-lemma-base-change-separated}.
Hence the direct implication in
Definition \ref{definition-property-morphisms-local}.

\medskip\noindent
Let $\{Y_i \to Y\}_{i \in I}$ be an fpqc covering of algebraic spaces over $S$.
Let $f : X \to Y$ be a morphism of algebraic spaces over $S$.
Assume each base change $X_i := Y_i \times_Y X \to Y_i$ is quasi-separated.
This means that each of the morphisms
$$
\Delta_i :
X_i
\longrightarrow
X_i \times_{Y_i} X_i = Y_i \times_Y (X \times_Y X)
$$
is quasi-compact. The base change of a fpqc covering is an fpqc covering, see
Topologies on Spaces, Lemma \ref{spaces-topologies-lemma-fpqc}
hence $\{Y_i \times_Y (X \times_Y X) \to X \times_Y X\}$
is an fpqc covering of algebraic spaces. Moreover, each
$\Delta_i$ is the base change of the morphism
$\Delta : X \to X \times_Y X$. Hence it follows from
Lemma \ref{lemma-descending-property-quasi-compact}
that $\Delta$ is quasi-compact, i.e., $f$ is quasi-separated.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-descending-property-universally-closed}
Let $S$ be a scheme.
The property $\mathcal{P}(f) =$``$f$ is universally closed''
is fpqc local on the base on algebraic spaces over $S$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
We will use
Lemma \ref{lemma-descending-properties-morphisms}
to prove this. Assumptions (1) and (2) of that lemma follow from
Morphisms of Spaces,
Lemma \ref{spaces-morphisms-lemma-universally-closed-local}.
Let $Z' \to Z$ be a surjective flat morphism of affine schemes over $S$.
Let $f : X \to Z$ be a morphism of algebraic spaces, and assume
that the base change $f' : Z' \times_Z X \to Z'$ is universally closed.
We have to show that $f$ is universally closed. To see this, using
Morphisms of Spaces,
Lemma \ref{spaces-morphisms-lemma-universally-closed-local}
again, it is enough to show that for every affine scheme $Y$ and
morphism $Y \to Z$ the map $|Y \times_Z X| \to |Y|$ is closed.
Consider the cube (\ref{equation-cube}).
The assumption that $f'$ is universally closed implies that
$|Y \times_Z Z' \times_Z X| \to |Y \times_Z Z'|$ is closed.
As $Y \times_Z Z' \to Y$ is surjective and flat as a base change of $Z' \to Z$
we see the map $|Y \times_Z Z'| \to |Y|$ is submersive, see
Morphisms, Lemma \ref{morphisms-lemma-fpqc-quotient-topology}.
Moreover the map
$$
|Y \times_Z Z' \times_Z X|
\longrightarrow
|Y \times_Z Z'| \times_{|Y|} |Y \times_Z X|
$$
is surjective, see
Properties of Spaces, Lemma \ref{spaces-properties-lemma-points-cartesian}.
It follows by elementary topology that $|Y \times_Z X| \to |Y|$ is closed.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-descending-property-universally-open}
Let $S$ be a scheme.
The property $\mathcal{P}(f) =$``$f$ is universally open''
is fpqc local on the base on algebraic spaces over $S$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
The proof is the same as the proof of
Lemma \ref{lemma-descending-property-universally-closed}.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-descending-property-surjective}
The property $\mathcal{P}(f) =$``$f$ is surjective''
is fpqc local on the base.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Omitted. (Hint: Use
Properties of Spaces, Lemma \ref{spaces-properties-lemma-points-cartesian}.)
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-descending-property-universally-injective}
The property $\mathcal{P}(f) =$``$f$ is universally injective''
is fpqc local on the base.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
We will use
Lemma \ref{lemma-descending-properties-morphisms}
to prove this. Assumptions (1) and (2) of that lemma follow from
Morphisms of Spaces,
Lemma \ref{spaces-morphisms-lemma-universally-closed-local}.
Let $Z' \to Z$ be a flat surjective morphism of affine schemes
over $S$ and let $f : X \to Z$ be a morphism from an algebraic space to $Z$.
Assume that the base change $f' : X' \to Z'$ is universally injective.
Let $K$ be a field, and let $a, b : \text{Spec}(K) \to X$
be two morphisms such that $f \circ a = f \circ b$.
As $Z' \to Z$ is surjective there exists a field
extension $K \subset K'$ and a morphism
$\text{Spec}(K') \to Z'$
such that the following solid diagram commutes
$$
\xymatrix{
\text{Spec}(K') \ar[rrd] \ar@{-->}[rd]_{a', b'} \ar[dd] \\
 &
X' \ar[r] \ar[d] &
Z' \ar[d] \\
\text{Spec}(K) \ar[r]^{a, b} &
X \ar[r] &
Z
}
$$
As the square is cartesian we get the two dotted arrows $a'$, $b'$ making the
diagram commute. Since $X' \to Z'$ is universally injective we get $a' = b'$.
This forces $a = b$ as $\{\text{Spec}(K') \to \text{Spec}(K)\}$
is an fpqc covering, see
Properties of Spaces, Lemma \ref{spaces-properties-lemma-separated-fpqc}.
Hence $f$ is universally injective as desired.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-descending-property-locally-finite-type}
The property $\mathcal{P}(f) =$``$f$ is locally of finite type''
is fpqc local on the base.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
We will use
Lemma \ref{lemma-descending-properties-morphisms}
to prove this. Assumptions (1) and (2) of that lemma follow from
Morphisms of Spaces,
Lemma \ref{spaces-morphisms-lemma-finite-type-local}.
Let $Z' \to Z$ be a surjective flat morphism of affine schemes over $S$.
Let $f : X \to Z$ be a morphism of algebraic spaces, and assume
that the base change $f' : Z' \times_Z X \to Z'$ is locally of finite type.
We have to show that $f$ is locally of finite type. Let $U$ be a scheme
and let $U \to X$ be surjective and etale. By
Morphisms of Spaces,
Lemma \ref{spaces-morphisms-lemma-finite-type-local}
again, it is enough to show that $U \to Z$ is locally of finite type.
Since $f'$ is locally of finite type, and since $Z' \times_Z U$ is a
scheme etale over $Z' \times_Z X$ we conclude (by the same lemma again) that
$Z' \times_Z U \to Z'$ is locally of finite type.
As $\{Z' \to Z\}$ is an fpqc covering we conclude that
$U \to Z$ is locally of finite type by
Descent, Lemma \ref{descent-lemma-descending-property-locally-finite-type}
as desired.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-descending-property-locally-finite-presentation}
The property $\mathcal{P}(f) =$``$f$ is locally of finite presentation''
is fpqc local on the base.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
We will use
Lemma \ref{lemma-descending-properties-morphisms}
to prove this. Assumptions (1) and (2) of that lemma follow from
Morphisms of Spaces,
Lemma \ref{spaces-morphisms-lemma-finite-presentation-local}.
Let $Z' \to Z$ be a surjective flat morphism of affine schemes over $S$.
Let $f : X \to Z$ be a morphism of algebraic spaces, and assume
that the base change $f' : Z' \times_Z X \to Z'$ is locally of
finite presentation.
We have to show that $f$ is locally of finite presentation. Let $U$ be a scheme
and let $U \to X$ be surjective and etale. By
Morphisms of Spaces,
Lemma \ref{spaces-morphisms-lemma-finite-presentation-local}
again, it is enough to show that $U \to Z$ is locally of finite presentation.
Since $f'$ is locally of finite presentation, and since $Z' \times_Z U$ is a
scheme etale over $Z' \times_Z X$ we conclude (by the same lemma again) that
$Z' \times_Z U \to Z'$ is locally of finite presentation.
As $\{Z' \to Z\}$ is an fpqc covering we conclude that
$U \to Z$ is locally of finite presentation by
Descent,
Lemma \ref{descent-lemma-descending-property-locally-finite-presentation}
as desired.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-descending-property-finite-type}
The property $\mathcal{P}(f) =$``$f$ is of finite type''
is fpqc local on the base.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Combine Lemmas \ref{lemma-descending-property-quasi-compact}
and \ref{lemma-descending-property-locally-finite-type}.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-descending-property-finite-presentation}
The property $\mathcal{P}(f) =$``$f$ is of finite presentation''
is fpqc local on the base.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Combine Lemmas \ref{lemma-descending-property-quasi-compact},
\ref{lemma-descending-property-quasi-separated} and
\ref{lemma-descending-property-locally-finite-presentation}.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-descending-property-flat}
The property $\mathcal{P}(f) =$``$f$ is flat''
is fpqc local on the base.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
We will use
Lemma \ref{lemma-descending-properties-morphisms}
to prove this. Assumptions (1) and (2) of that lemma follow from
Morphisms of Spaces,
Lemma \ref{spaces-morphisms-lemma-flat-local}.
Let $Z' \to Z$ be a surjective flat morphism of affine schemes over $S$.
Let $f : X \to Z$ be a morphism of algebraic spaces, and assume
that the base change $f' : Z' \times_Z X \to Z'$ is flat.
We have to show that $f$ is flat. Let $U$ be a scheme
and let $U \to X$ be surjective and etale. By
Morphisms of Spaces,
Lemma \ref{spaces-morphisms-lemma-flat-local}
again, it is enough to show that $U \to Z$ is flat.
Since $f'$ is flat, and since $Z' \times_Z U$ is a
scheme etale over $Z' \times_Z X$ we conclude (by the same lemma again) that
$Z' \times_Z U \to Z'$ is flat.
As $\{Z' \to Z\}$ is an fpqc covering we conclude that
$U \to Z$ is flat by
Descent, Lemma \ref{descent-lemma-descending-property-flat}
as desired.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-descending-property-open-immersion}
The property $\mathcal{P}(f) =$``$f$ is an open immersion''
is fpqc local on the base.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
We will use
Lemma \ref{lemma-descending-properties-morphisms}
to prove this. Assumptions (1) and (2) of that lemma follow from
Morphisms of Spaces,
Lemma \ref{spaces-morphisms-lemma-closed-immersion-local}.
Consider a cartesian diagram
$$
\xymatrix{
X' \ar[r] \ar[d] & X \ar[d] \\
Z' \ar[r] & Z
}
$$
of algebraic spaces over $S$
where $Z' \to Z$ is a surjective flat morphism of affine schemes,
and $X' \to Z'$ is an open immersion. We have to show that $X \to Z$
is an open immersion. Note that $|X'| \subset |Z'|$ corresponds to an
open subscheme $U' \subset Z'$ (isomorphic to $X'$)
with the property that $\text{pr}_0^{-1}(U') = \text{pr}_1^{-1}(U')$
as open subschemes of $Z' \times_Z Z'$. Hence there exists an open
subscheme $U \subset Z$ such that $X' = (Z' \to Z)^{-1}(U)$, see
Descent, Lemma \ref{descent-lemma-open-fpqc-covering}.
As $X' \to Z'$ is quasi-separated also $X \to Z$ is quasi-separated, by
Lemma \ref{lemma-descending-property-quasi-separated}.
Hence $X$ is quasi-separated over $S$ (since $Z$ is affine, hence separated,
hence $Z \to S$ is separated, hence $X \to Z \to S$ is quasi-separated by
Morphisms of Spaces, Lemma \ref{spaces-morphisms-lemma-composition-separated}).
Thus by
Properties of Spaces,
Lemma \ref{spaces-properties-lemma-sheaf-fpqc-quasi-separated}
we see that $X$ satisfies the sheaf condition for the fpqc topology.
Now we have the fpqc covering $\mathcal{U} = \{U' \to U\}$
and the element $U' \to X' \to X \in \check{H}^0(\mathcal{U}, X)$.
By the sheaf condition we obtain a morphism $U \to X$ such that
$$
\xymatrix{
U' \ar[r] \ar[d]^{\cong} \ar@/_3ex/[dd] & U \ar[d] \ar@/^3ex/[dd] \\
X' \ar[r] \ar[d] & X \ar[d] \\
Z' \ar[r] & Z
}
$$
is commutative. On the other hand, we know that for any scheme $T$ pver $S$
and $T$-valued point $T \to X$ the composition $T \to X \to Z$ is a
morphism such that $Z' \times_Z T \to Z'$ factors through $U'$. Clearly
this means that $T \to Z$ factors through $U$. In other words the map
of sheaves $U \to X$ is bijective and we win.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-descending-property-isomorphism}
The property $\mathcal{P}(f) =$``$f$ is an isomorphism''
is fpqc local on the base.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Combine Lemmas \ref{lemma-descending-property-surjective}
and \ref{lemma-descending-property-open-immersion}.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-descending-property-affine}
The property $\mathcal{P}(f) =$``$f$ is affine''
is fpqc local on the base.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
We will use
Lemma \ref{lemma-descending-properties-morphisms}
to prove this. Assumptions (1) and (2) of that lemma follow from
Morphisms of Spaces,
Lemma \ref{spaces-morphisms-lemma-affine-local}.
Let $Z' \to Z$ be a surjective flat morphism of affine schemes over $S$.
Let $f : X \to Z$ be a morphism of algebraic spaces, and assume
that the base change $f' : Z' \times_Z X \to Z'$ is affine.
This implies that $Z' \times_Z X$ is representable, and
that $Z' \times_Z X \to Z'$ is quasi-separated. Hence we conclude
that $X \to Z$ is quasi-separated by
Lemma \ref{lemma-descending-property-quasi-separated}.
In particular $X$ is quasi-separated over $S$, and satisfies the
sheaf condition for the fpqc topology, see
Properties of Spaces,
Lemma \ref{spaces-properties-lemma-sheaf-fpqc-quasi-separated}.

\medskip\noindent
Let $X'$ be a scheme representing $Z' \times_Z X$.
We obtain a canonical isomorphism
$$
\varphi : X' \times_Z Z' \longrightarrow Z' \times_Z X'
$$
since both schemes represent the algebraic space $Z' \times_Z Z' \times_Z X$.
This is a descent datum for $X'/Z'/Z$, see
Descent, Definition \ref{descent-definition-descent-datum}
(verification omitted, compare with
Descent, Lemma \ref{descent-lemma-descent-data-sheaves}).
Since $X' \to Z'$ is affine this descent datum is effective, see
Descent, Lemma \ref{descent-lemma-affine}.
Thus there exists a scheme $Y \to Z$ over $Z$ and an
isomorphism $\psi : Z' \times_Z Y \to X'$ compatible with descent data.
Of course $Y \to Z$ is affine (by construction or by
Descent, Lemma \ref{descent-lemma-descending-property-affine}).
Note that $\mathcal{Y} = \{Z' \times_Z Y \to Y\}$ is a
fpqc covering, and interpreting $\psi$ as an element of
$X(Z' \times_Z Y)$ we see that $\psi \in \check{H}^0(\mathcal{Y}, X)$.
By the sheaf condition for $X$ (see above) we obtain a morphism $Y \to X$.
By construction the base change of this to $Z'$ is an isomorphism, hence
an isomorphism by
Lemma \ref{lemma-descending-property-isomorphism}.
This proves that $X$ is representable by an affine scheme and we win.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-descending-property-closed-immersion}
The property $\mathcal{P}(f) =$``$f$ is a closed immersion''
is fpqc local on the base.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
We will use
Lemma \ref{lemma-descending-properties-morphisms}
to prove this. Assumptions (1) and (2) of that lemma follow from
Morphisms of Spaces,
Lemma \ref{spaces-morphisms-lemma-closed-immersion-local}.
Consider a cartesian diagram
$$
\xymatrix{
X' \ar[r] \ar[d] & X \ar[d] \\
Z' \ar[r] & Z
}
$$
of algebraic spaces over $S$
where $Z' \to Z$ is a surjective flat morphism of affine schemes,
and $X' \to Z'$ is a closed immersion. We have to show that $X \to Z$
is a closed immersion. The morphism $X' \to Z'$ is affine. Hence by
Lemma \ref{lemma-descending-property-affine}
we see that $X$ is a scheme and $X \to Z$ is affine.
It follows from
Descent, Lemma \ref{descent-lemma-descending-property-closed-immersion}
that $X \to Z$ is a closed immersion as desired.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-descending-property-separated}
The property $\mathcal{P}(f) =$``$f$ is separated''
is fpqc local on the base.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
A base change of a separated morphism is separated, see
Morphisms of Spaces,
Lemma \ref{spaces-morphisms-lemma-base-change-separated}.
Hence the direct implication in
Definition \ref{definition-property-morphisms-local}.

\medskip\noindent
Let $\{Y_i \to Y\}_{i \in I}$ be an fpqc covering of algebraic spaces over $S$.
Let $f : X \to Y$ be a morphism of algebraic spaces over $S$.
Assume each base change $X_i := Y_i \times_Y X \to Y_i$ is separated.
This means that each of the morphisms
$$
\Delta_i :
X_i
\longrightarrow
X_i \times_{Y_i} X_i = Y_i \times_Y (X \times_Y X)
$$
is a closed immersion. The base change of a fpqc covering is an
fpqc covering, see
Topologies on Spaces, Lemma \ref{spaces-topologies-lemma-fpqc}
hence $\{Y_i \times_Y (X \times_Y X) \to X \times_Y X\}$
is an fpqc covering of algebraic spaces. Moreover, each
$\Delta_i$ is the base change of the morphism
$\Delta : X \to X \times_Y X$. Hence it follows from
Lemma \ref{lemma-descending-property-closed-immersion}
that $\Delta$ is a closed immersion, i.e., $f$ is separated.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-descending-property-proper}
The property $\mathcal{P}(f) =$``$f$ is proper''
is fpqc local on the base.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
The lemma follows by combining
Lemmas \ref{lemma-descending-property-universally-closed},
\ref{lemma-descending-property-separated}
and \ref{lemma-descending-property-finite-type}.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-descending-property-quasi-affine}
The property $\mathcal{P}(f) =$``$f$ is quasi-affine''
is fpqc local on the base.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
We will use
Lemma \ref{lemma-descending-properties-morphisms}
to prove this. Assumptions (1) and (2) of that lemma follow from
Morphisms of Spaces,
Lemma \ref{spaces-morphisms-lemma-quasi-affine-local}.
Let $Z' \to Z$ be a surjective flat morphism of affine schemes over $S$.
Let $f : X \to Z$ be a morphism of algebraic spaces, and assume
that the base change $f' : Z' \times_Z X \to Z'$ is quasi-affine.
This implies that $Z' \times_Z X$ is representable, and
that $Z' \times_Z X \to Z'$ is quasi-separated. Hence we conclude
that $X \to Z$ is quasi-separated by
Lemma \ref{lemma-descending-property-quasi-separated}.
In particular $X$ is quasi-separated over $S$, and satisfies the
sheaf condition for the fpqc topology, see
Properties of Spaces,
Lemma \ref{spaces-properties-lemma-sheaf-fpqc-quasi-separated}.

\medskip\noindent
Let $X'$ be a scheme representing $Z' \times_Z X$.
We obtain a canonical isomorphism
$$
\varphi : X' \times_Z Z' \longrightarrow Z' \times_Z X'
$$
since both schemes represent the algebraic space $Z' \times_Z Z' \times_Z X$.
This is a descent datum for $X'/Z'/Z$, see
Descent, Definition \ref{descent-definition-descent-datum}
(verification omitted, compare with
Descent, Lemma \ref{descent-lemma-descent-data-sheaves}).
Since $X' \to Z'$ is quasi-affine this descent datum is effective, see
Descent, Lemma \ref{descent-lemma-quasi-affine}.
Thus there exists a scheme $Y \to Z$ over $Z$ and an
isomorphism $\psi : Z' \times_Z Y \to X'$ compatible with descent data.
Of course $Y \to Z$ is quasi-affine (by construction or by
Descent, Lemma \ref{descent-lemma-descending-property-quasi-affine}).
Note that $\mathcal{Y} = \{Z' \times_Z Y \to Y\}$ is a
fpqc covering, and interpreting $\psi$ as an element of
$X(Z' \times_Z Y)$ we see that $\psi \in \check{H}^0(\mathcal{Y}, X)$.
By the sheaf condition for $X$ (see above) we obtain a morphism $Y \to X$.
By construction the base change of this to $Z'$ is an isomorphism, hence
an isomorphism by
Lemma \ref{lemma-descending-property-isomorphism}.
This proves that $X$ is representable by a quasi-affine scheme and we win.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-descending-property-quasi-compact-immersion}
The property $\mathcal{P}(f) =$``$f$ is a quasi-compact immersion''
is fpqc local on the base.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
We will use
Lemma \ref{lemma-descending-properties-morphisms}
to prove this. Assumptions (1) and (2) of that lemma follow from
Morphisms of Spaces,
Lemmas \ref{spaces-morphisms-lemma-closed-immersion-local} and
\ref{spaces-morphisms-lemma-quasi-compact-local}.
Consider a cartesian diagram
$$
\xymatrix{
X' \ar[r] \ar[d] & X \ar[d] \\
Z' \ar[r] & Z
}
$$
of algebraic spaces over $S$
where $Z' \to Z$ is a surjective flat morphism of affine schemes,
and $X' \to Z'$ is a quasi-compact immersion. We have to show that $X \to Z$
is a closed immersion. The morphism $X' \to Z'$ is quasi-affine. Hence by
Lemma \ref{lemma-descending-property-quasi-affine}
we see that $X$ is a scheme and $X \to Z$ is quasi-affine.
It follows from
Descent, Lemma \ref{descent-lemma-descending-property-quasi-compact-immersion}
that $X \to Z$ is a quasi-compact immersion as desired.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-descending-property-integral}
The property $\mathcal{P}(f) =$``$f$ is integral''
is fpqc local on the base.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
An integral morphism is the same thing as an affine,
universally closed morphism. See
Morphisms of Spaces,
Lemma \ref{spaces-morphisms-lemma-integral-universally-closed}.
Hence the lemma follows on combining
Lemmas \ref{lemma-descending-property-universally-closed}
and \ref{lemma-descending-property-affine}.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-descending-property-finite}
The property $\mathcal{P}(f) =$``$f$ is finite''
is fpqc local on the base.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
An finite morphism is the same thing as an integral,
morphism which is locally of finite type. See
Morphisms of Spaces, Lemma \ref{spaces-morphisms-lemma-finite-integral}.
Hence the lemma follows on combining
Lemmas \ref{lemma-descending-property-locally-finite-type}
and \ref{lemma-descending-property-integral}.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-descending-property-quasi-finite}
The properties
$\mathcal{P}(f) =$``$f$ is locally quasi-finite''
and
$\mathcal{P}(f) =$``$f$ is quasi-finite''
are fpqc local on the base.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
We have already seen that ``quasi-compact'' is fpqc local on the base, see
Lemma \ref{lemma-descending-property-quasi-compact}. Hence it is enough
to prove the lemma for ``locally quasi-finite''. We will use
Lemma \ref{lemma-descending-properties-morphisms}
to prove this. Assumptions (1) and (2) of that lemma follow from
Morphisms of Spaces,
Lemma \ref{spaces-morphisms-lemma-quasi-finite-local}.
Let $Z' \to Z$ be a surjective flat morphism of affine schemes over $S$.
Let $f : X \to Z$ be a morphism of algebraic spaces, and assume
that the base change $f' : Z' \times_Z X \to Z'$ is locally quasi-finite.
We have to show that $f$ is locally quasi-finite. Let $U$ be a scheme
and let $U \to X$ be surjective and etale. By
Morphisms of Spaces,
Lemma \ref{spaces-morphisms-lemma-quasi-finite-local}
again, it is enough to show that $U \to Z$ is locally quasi-finite.
Since $f'$ is locally quasi-finite, and since $Z' \times_Z U$ is a
scheme etale over $Z' \times_Z X$ we conclude (by the same lemma again) that
$Z' \times_Z U \to Z'$ is locally quasi-finite.
As $\{Z' \to Z\}$ is an fpqc covering we conclude that
$U \to Z$ is locally quasi-finite by
Descent, Lemma \ref{descent-lemma-descending-property-quasi-finite}
as desired.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-descending-property-syntomic}
The property $\mathcal{P}(f) =$``$f$ is syntomic''
is fpqc local on the base.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
We will use
Lemma \ref{lemma-descending-properties-morphisms}
to prove this. Assumptions (1) and (2) of that lemma follow from
Morphisms of Spaces,
Lemma \ref{spaces-morphisms-lemma-syntomic-local}.
Let $Z' \to Z$ be a surjective flat morphism of affine schemes over $S$.
Let $f : X \to Z$ be a morphism of algebraic spaces, and assume
that the base change $f' : Z' \times_Z X \to Z'$ is syntomic.
We have to show that $f$ is syntomic. Let $U$ be a scheme
and let $U \to X$ be surjective and etale. By
Morphisms of Spaces,
Lemma \ref{spaces-morphisms-lemma-syntomic-local}
again, it is enough to show that $U \to Z$ is syntomic.
Since $f'$ is syntomic, and since $Z' \times_Z U$ is a
scheme etale over $Z' \times_Z X$ we conclude (by the same lemma again) that
$Z' \times_Z U \to Z'$ is syntomic.
As $\{Z' \to Z\}$ is an fpqc covering we conclude that
$U \to Z$ is syntomic by
Descent, Lemma \ref{descent-lemma-descending-property-syntomic}
as desired.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-descending-property-smooth}
The property $\mathcal{P}(f) =$``$f$ is smooth''
is fpqc local on the base.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
We will use
Lemma \ref{lemma-descending-properties-morphisms}
to prove this. Assumptions (1) and (2) of that lemma follow from
Morphisms of Spaces,
Lemma \ref{spaces-morphisms-lemma-smooth-local}.
Let $Z' \to Z$ be a surjective flat morphism of affine schemes over $S$.
Let $f : X \to Z$ be a morphism of algebraic spaces, and assume
that the base change $f' : Z' \times_Z X \to Z'$ is smooth.
We have to show that $f$ is smooth. Let $U$ be a scheme
and let $U \to X$ be surjective and etale. By
Morphisms of Spaces,
Lemma \ref{spaces-morphisms-lemma-smooth-local}
again, it is enough to show that $U \to Z$ is smooth.
Since $f'$ is smooth, and since $Z' \times_Z U$ is a
scheme etale over $Z' \times_Z X$ we conclude (by the same lemma again) that
$Z' \times_Z U \to Z'$ is smooth.
As $\{Z' \to Z\}$ is an fpqc covering we conclude that
$U \to Z$ is smooth by
Descent, Lemma \ref{descent-lemma-descending-property-smooth}
as desired.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-descending-property-unramified}
The property $\mathcal{P}(f) =$``$f$ is unramified''
is fpqc local on the base.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
We will use
Lemma \ref{lemma-descending-properties-morphisms}
to prove this. Assumptions (1) and (2) of that lemma follow from
Morphisms of Spaces,
Lemma \ref{spaces-morphisms-lemma-unramified-local}.
Let $Z' \to Z$ be a surjective flat morphism of affine schemes over $S$.
Let $f : X \to Z$ be a morphism of algebraic spaces, and assume
that the base change $f' : Z' \times_Z X \to Z'$ is unramified.
We have to show that $f$ is unramified. Let $U$ be a scheme
and let $U \to X$ be surjective and etale. By
Morphisms of Spaces,
Lemma \ref{spaces-morphisms-lemma-unramified-local}
again, it is enough to show that $U \to Z$ is unramified.
Since $f'$ is unramified, and since $Z' \times_Z U$ is a
scheme etale over $Z' \times_Z X$ we conclude (by the same lemma again) that
$Z' \times_Z U \to Z'$ is unramified.
As $\{Z' \to Z\}$ is an fpqc covering we conclude that
$U \to Z$ is unramified by
Descent, Lemma \ref{descent-lemma-descending-property-unramified}
as desired.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-descending-property-etale}
The property $\mathcal{P}(f) =$``$f$ is etale''
is fpqc local on the base.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
We will use
Lemma \ref{lemma-descending-properties-morphisms}
to prove this. Assumptions (1) and (2) of that lemma follow from
Morphisms of Spaces,
Lemma \ref{spaces-morphisms-lemma-etale-local}.
Let $Z' \to Z$ be a surjective flat morphism of affine schemes over $S$.
Let $f : X \to Z$ be a morphism of algebraic spaces, and assume
that the base change $f' : Z' \times_Z X \to Z'$ is etale.
We have to show that $f$ is etale. Let $U$ be a scheme
and let $U \to X$ be surjective and etale. By
Morphisms of Spaces,
Lemma \ref{spaces-morphisms-lemma-etale-local}
again, it is enough to show that $U \to Z$ is etale.
Since $f'$ is etale, and since $Z' \times_Z U$ is a
scheme etale over $Z' \times_Z X$ we conclude (by the same lemma again) that
$Z' \times_Z U \to Z'$ is etale.
As $\{Z' \to Z\}$ is an fpqc covering we conclude that
$U \to Z$ is etale by
Descent, Lemma \ref{descent-lemma-descending-property-etale}
as desired.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-descending-property-finite-locally-free}
The property $\mathcal{P}(f) =$``$f$ is finite locally free''
is fpqc local on the base.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Being finite locally free is equivalent to being
finite, flat and locally of finite presentation
(Morphisms of Spaces, Lemma \ref{spaces-morphisms-lemma-finite-flat}).
Hence this follows from Lemmas
\ref{lemma-descending-property-finite},
\ref{lemma-descending-property-flat}, and
\ref{lemma-descending-property-locally-finite-presentation}.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-descending-property-monomorphism}
The property $\mathcal{P}(f) =$``$f$ is a monomorphism''
is fpqc local on the base.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Let $f : X \to Y$ be a morphism of algebraic spaces.
Let $\{Y_i \to Y\}$ be an fpqc covering, and assume
each of the base changes $f_i : X_i \to Y_i$ of $f$ is
a monomorphism. We have to show that $f$ is a monomorphism.

\medskip\noindent
Let $V$ be a scheme, and let $V \to Y$ be a surjective etale morphism.
If we can show that $V \times_Y X \to V$ is a monomorphism, then it
follows that $X \to Y$ is a monomorphism. Namely, given any
cartesian diagram of sheaves
$$
\vcenter{
\xymatrix{
\mathcal{F} \ar[r]_a \ar[d]_b & \mathcal{G} \ar[d]^c \\
\mathcal{H} \ar[r]^d & \mathcal{I}
}
}
\quad
\quad
\mathcal{F} = \mathcal{H} \times_\mathcal{I} \mathcal{G}
$$
if $c$ is a surjection of sheaves, and $a$ is injective, then also
$d$ is injective. This reduces the problem to the case where $Y$ is
a scheme. Moreover, in this case we may assume that the algebraic spaces
$Y_i$ are schemes also, since we can always refine the covering to place
ourselves in this situation, see
Topologies on Spaces, Lemma \ref{spaces-topologies-lemma-refine-fpqc-schemes}.

\medskip\noindent
Assume $\{Y_i \to Y\}$ is an fpqc covering of schemes.
Let $a, b : T \to X$ be two morphisms
such that $f \circ a = f \circ b$. We have to show that $a = b$.
Since $f_i$ is a monomorphism we see that $a_i = b_i$, where
$a_i, b_i : Y_i \times_Y T \to X_i$ are
the base changes. In particular the compositions
$Y_i \times_Y T \to T \to X$ are equal.
Since $\{Y_i \times_Y T \to T\}$ is an fpqc covering we
deduce that $a = b$ from
Properties of Spaces, Lemma \ref{spaces-properties-lemma-separated-fpqc}.
\end{proof}




\section{Descending properties of morphisms in the fppf topology}
\label{section-descending-properties-morphisms-fppf}

\noindent
In this section we find some properties of morphisms of algebraic spaces
for which we could not (yet) show they are local on the base in
the fpqc topology which, however, are local on the base
in the fppf topology.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-descending-fppf-property-immersion}
The property $\mathcal{P}(f) =$``$f$ is an immersion''
is fppf local on the base.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Let $f : X \to Y$ be a morphism of algebraic spaces.
Let $\{Y_i \to Y\}_{i \in I}$ be an fppf covering of $Y$.
Let $f_i : X_i \to Y_i$ be the base change of $f$.

\medskip\noindent
If $f$ is an immersion, then each $f_i$ is an immersion by
Morphisms of Spaces,
Lemma \ref{spaces-lemma-base-change-immersions}.
This proves the direct implication in
Definition \ref{definition-property-morphisms-local}.

\medskip\noindent
Conversely, assume each $f_i$ is an immersion. By
Morphisms of Spaces,
Lemma \ref{spaces-morphisms-lemma-immersions-monomorphisms}
this implies each $f_i$ is separated. By
Morphisms of Spaces,
Lemma \ref{spaces-morphisms-lemma-immersion-quasi-finite}
this implies each $f_i$ is locally quasi-finite.
Hence we see that $f$ is locally quasi-finite and separated, by applying
Lemmas \ref{lemma-descending-property-separated}
and \ref{lemma-descending-property-quasi-finite}.
By
Morphisms of Spaces, Lemma
\ref{spaces-morphisms-lemma-locally-quasi-finite-separated-representable}
this implies that $f$ is representable!

\medskip\noindent
By
Morphisms of Spaces, Lemma \ref{spaces-morphisms-lemma-closed-immersion-local}
it suffices to show that for every scheme $Z$ and morphism $Z \to Y$
the base change $Z \times_Y X \to Z$ is an immersion. By
Topologies on Spaces, Lemma \ref{spaces-topologies-lemma-refine-fppf-schemes}
we can find an fppf covering $\{Z_i \to Z\}$ by schemes which refines
the pull back of the covering $\{Y_i \to Y\}$ to $Z$.
Hence we see that $Z \times_Y X \to Z$ (which is a morphism of schemes
according to the result of the preceding paragraph) becomes an immersion
after pulling back to the members of an fppf (by schemes) of $Z$.
Hence $Z \times_Y X \to Z$ is an immersion by the result for schemes, see
Descent, Lemma \ref{descent-lemma-descending-fppf-property-immersion}.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-descending-fppf-property-locally-separated}
The property $\mathcal{P}(f) =$``$f$ is locally separated''
is fppf local on the base.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
A base change of a locally separated morphism is locally separated, see
Morphisms of Spaces,
Lemma \ref{spaces-morphisms-lemma-base-change-separated}.
Hence the direct implication in
Definition \ref{definition-property-morphisms-local}.

\medskip\noindent
Let $\{Y_i \to Y\}_{i \in I}$ be an fppf covering of algebraic spaces over $S$.
Let $f : X \to Y$ be a morphism of algebraic spaces over $S$.
Assume each base change $X_i := Y_i \times_Y X \to Y_i$ is locally separated.
This means that each of the morphisms
$$
\Delta_i :
X_i
\longrightarrow
X_i \times_{Y_i} X_i = Y_i \times_Y (X \times_Y X)
$$
is an immersion. The base change of a fppf covering is an
fppf covering, see
Topologies on Spaces, Lemma \ref{spaces-topologies-lemma-fppf}
hence $\{Y_i \times_Y (X \times_Y X) \to X \times_Y X\}$
is an fppf covering of algebraic spaces. Moreover, each
$\Delta_i$ is the base change of the morphism
$\Delta : X \to X \times_Y X$. Hence it follows from
Lemma \ref{lemma-descending-fppf-property-immersion}
that $\Delta$ is a immersion, i.e., $f$ is locally separated.
\end{proof}
