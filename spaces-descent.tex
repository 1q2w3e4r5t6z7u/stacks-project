\section{Introduction}
\label{section-introduction}

\noindent
In the chapter on topologies on algebraic spaces (see
Topologies on Spaces, Section \ref{spaces-topologies-section-introduction})
we introduced etale, fppf, smooth, syntomic and fpqc coverings of
algebraic spaces.
In this chapter we discuss what kind of structures over algebraic spaces
can be descended through such coverings.
See for example \cite{Gr-I}, \cite{Gr-II}, \cite{Gr-III},
\cite{Gr-IV}, \cite{Gr-V}, and \cite{Gr-VI}.



\section{Conventions}
\label{section-conventions}

\noindent
The standing assumption is that all schemes are contained in
a big fppf site $\textit{Sch}_{fppf}$. And all rings $A$ considered
have the property that $\text{Spec}(A)$ is (isomorphic) to an
object of this big site.

\medskip\noindent
Let $S$ be a scheme and let $X$ be an algebraic space over $S$.
In this chapter and the following we will write $X \times_S X$
for the product of $X$ with itself (in the category of algebraic
spaces over $S$), instead of $X \times X$.













\section{Descending properties of morphisms}
\label{section-descending-properties-morphisms}

\noindent
In this section we introduce the notion of when a property of morphisms of
algebraic spaces is local on the target in a topology. Please compare with
Descent, Section \ref{descent-section-descending-properties-morphisms}.

\begin{definition}
\label{definition-property-morphisms-local}
Let $S$ be a scheme.
Let $\mathcal{P}$ be a property of morphisms of algebraic spaces over $S$.
Let $\tau \in \{fpqc, fppf, syntomic, smooth, etale\}$.
We say $\mathcal{P}$ is {\it $\tau$ local on the base}, or
{\it $\tau$ local on the target}, or
{\it local on the base for the $\tau$-topology} if for any
$\tau$-covering $\{Y_i \to Y\}_{i \in I}$ of algebraic spaces
and any morphism of algebraic spaces $f : X \to Y$ we 
have
$$
f \text{ has }\mathcal{P}
\Leftrightarrow
\text{each }Y_i \times_Y X \to Y_i\text{ has }\mathcal{P}.
$$
\end{definition}

\noindent
It is probably best to only consider this notion for properties of morphisms
which are already known to be stable under arbitrary base change (since it is
easy to forget to check the direct implication).





\section{Descending properties of morphisms in the fpqc topology}
\label{section-descending-properties-morphisms-fpqc}


\noindent
In this section we find a large number of properties
of morphisms of algebraic spaces which are local on the base
in the fpqc topology. Please compare with
Descent, Section \ref{descent-section-descending-properties-morphisms-fpqc}
for the case of morphisms of schemes.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-descending-property-quasi-compact}
Let $S$ be a scheme.
The property $\mathcal{P}(f) =$``$f$ is quasi-compact''
is fpqc local on the base on algebraic spaces over $S$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
A base change of a quasi-compact morphism is quasi-compact, see
Morphisms of Spaces,
Lemma \ref{spaces-morphisms-lemma-base-change-quasi-compact}.
Hence the direct implication in
Definition \ref{definition-property-morphisms-local}.

\medskip\noindent
Let $\{Y_i \to Y\}_{i \in I}$ be an fpqc covering of algebraic spaces over $S$.
Let $f : X \to Y$ be a morphism of algebraic spaces over $S$.
Assume each base change $f_i : Y_i \times_Y X \to Y_i$ is quasi-compact.
Let $Z$ be an affine scheme, and let $Z \to Y$ be a morphism.
We have to show that the algebraic space $Z \times_Y X$ is quasi-compact, see
Morphisms of Spaces,
Lemma \ref{spaces-morphisms-lemma-characterize-quasi-compact}.
Since $\{Y_i \to Y\}_{i \in I}$ is an fpqc covering we know there
exists a standard fpqc covering $\{Z_j \to Z\}_{j = 1, \ldots , n}$
and morphisms $Z_j \to Y_{i_j}$ over $Y$ for suitable indices $i_j \in I$.
Since $f_{i_j}$ is quasi-compact we see that
$$
Z_j \times_Y X
=
Z_j \times_{Y_{i_j}} (Y_{i_j} \times_Y X)
$$
is quasi-compact.
Since $\coprod_{j = 1, \ldots, n} Z_j \to Z$ is surjective,
also $\coprod_{j = 1, \ldots, n} Z_j \times_Y X \to Z \times_Y X$ is
surjective (by
Morphisms of Spaces,
Lemma \ref{spaces-morphisms-lemma-base-change-surjective}).
Hence $Z \times_Y X$ is quasi-compact (use
Morphisms of Spaces,
Lemma \ref{spaces-morphisms-lemma-surjection-from-quasi-compact}
and
Properties of Spaces,
Lemma \ref{spaces-properties-lemma-finite-disjoint-quasi-compact})
as desired.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-descending-property-quasi-separated}
Let $S$ be a scheme.
The property $\mathcal{P}(f) =$``$f$ is quasi-separated''
is fpqc local on the base on algebraic spaces over $S$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
A base change of a quasi-separated morphism is quasi-separated, see
Morphisms of Spaces,
Lemma \ref{spaces-morphisms-lemma-base-change-separated}.
Hence the direct implication in
Definition \ref{definition-property-morphisms-local}.

\medskip\noindent
Let $\{Y_i \to Y\}_{i \in I}$ be an fpqc covering of algebraic spaces over $S$.
Let $f : X \to Y$ be a morphism of algebraic spaces over $S$.
Assume each base change $X_i := Y_i \times_Y X \to Y_i$ is quasi-separated.
This means that each of the morphisms
$$
\Delta_i :
X_i
\longrightarrow
X_i \times_{Y_i} X_i = Y_i \times_Y (X \times_Y X)
$$
is quasi-compact. The base change of a fpqc covering is an fpqc covering, see
Topologies on Spaces, Lemma \ref{spaces-topologies-lemma-fpqc}
hence $\{Y_i \times_Y (X \times_Y X) \to X \times_Y X\}$
is an fpqc covering of algebraic spaces. Moreover, each
$\Delta_i$ is the base change of the morphism
$\Delta : X \to X \times_Y X$. Hence it follows from
Lemma \ref{lemma-descending-property-quasi-compact}
that $\Delta$ is quasi-compact, i.e., $f$ is quasi-separated.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-descending-property-universally-closed}
Let $S$ be a scheme.
The property $\mathcal{P}(f) =$``$f$ is universally closed''
is fpqc local on the base on algebraic spaces over $S$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
A base change of a universally closed morphism is universally closed, see
Morphisms of Spaces,
Lemma \ref{spaces-morphisms-lemma-base-change-universally-closed}.
Hence the direct implication in
Definition \ref{definition-property-morphisms-local}.

\medskip\noindent
Let $\{Y_i \to Y\}_{i \in I}$ be an fpqc covering of algebraic spaces over $S$.
Let $f : X \to Y$ be a morphism of algebraic spaces over $S$.
Assume each base change $f_i : Y_i \times_Y X \to Y_i$ is universally closed.
Let $Z$ be an affine scheme, and let $Z \to Y$ be a morphism.
We have to show that $|Z \times_Y X| \to |Z|$ is closed, see
Morphisms of Spaces,
Lemma \ref{spaces-morphisms-lemma-characterize-universally-closed}.
Since $\{Y_i \to Y\}_{i \in I}$ is an fpqc covering we know there
exists a standard fpqc covering $\{Z_j \to Z\}_{j = 1, \ldots , n}$
and morphisms $Z_j \to Y_{i_j}$ over $Y$ for suitable indices $i_j \in I$.
Since $f_{i_j}$ is quasi-compact we see that
$$
Z_j \times_Y X
=
Z_j \times_{Y_{i_j}} (Y_{i_j} \times_Y X)
\longrightarrow
Z_j
$$
is universally closed.
Since $\coprod_{j = 1, \ldots, n} Z_j \to Z$ is surjective,
also $\coprod_{j = 1, \ldots, n} Z_j \times_Y X \to Z \times_Y X$ is
surjective (by
Morphisms of Spaces,
Lemma \ref{spaces-morphisms-lemma-base-change-surjective}).
Consider the following commutative diagram
$$
\xymatrix{
\coprod_{j = 1, \ldots, n} Z_j \times_Y X \ar[d] \ar[r] &
Z \times_Y X \ar[d] \\
\coprod_{j = 1, \ldots, n} Z_j \ar[r] &
Z
}
$$
The horizontal arrows are surjective, quasi-compact and flat, hence
Morphisms of Spaces, Lemma \ref{spaces-morphisms-lemma-fpqc-quotient-topology}
applies to them. The map
$$
\left|\coprod\nolimits_{j = 1, \ldots, n} Z_j \times_Y X\right|
\longrightarrow
\left|\coprod\nolimits_{j = 1, \ldots, n} Z_j\right|
\times_{|Z|}
|Z \times_Y X|
$$
is surjective by
Properties of Spaces, Lemma \ref{spaces-properties-lemma-points-cartesian}.
Combining the above the closedness of $|Z \times_Y X| \to |Z|$ follows.
\end{proof}
