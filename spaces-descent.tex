\section{Introduction}
\label{section-introduction}

\noindent
In the chapter on topologies on algebraic spaces (see
Topologies on Spaces, Section \ref{spaces-topologies-section-introduction})
we introduced etale, fppf, smooth, syntomic and fpqc coverings of
algebraic spaces.
In this chapter we discuss what kind of structures over algebraic spaces
can be descended through such coverings.
See for example \cite{Gr-I}, \cite{Gr-II}, \cite{Gr-III},
\cite{Gr-IV}, \cite{Gr-V}, and \cite{Gr-VI}.



\section{Conventions}
\label{section-conventions}

\noindent
The standing assumption is that all schemes are contained in
a big fppf site $\textit{Sch}_{fppf}$. And all rings $A$ considered
have the property that $\text{Spec}(A)$ is (isomorphic) to an
object of this big site.

\medskip\noindent
Let $S$ be a scheme and let $X$ be an algebraic space over $S$.
In this chapter and the following we will write $X \times_S X$
for the product of $X$ with itself (in the category of algebraic
spaces over $S$), instead of $X \times X$.













\section{Descending properties of morphisms}
\label{section-descending-properties-morphisms}

\noindent
In this section we introduce the notion of when a property of morphisms of
algebraic spaces is local on the target in a topology. Please compare with
Descent, Section \ref{descent-section-descending-properties-morphisms}.

\begin{definition}
\label{definition-property-morphisms-local}
Let $S$ be a scheme.
Let $\mathcal{P}$ be a property of morphisms of algebraic spaces over $S$.
Let $\tau \in \{fpqc, fppf, syntomic, smooth, etale\}$.
We say $\mathcal{P}$ is {\it $\tau$ local on the base}, or
{\it $\tau$ local on the target}, or
{\it local on the base for the $\tau$-topology} if for any
$\tau$-covering $\{Y_i \to Y\}_{i \in I}$ of algebraic spaces
and any morphism of algebraic spaces $f : X \to Y$ we 
have
$$
f \text{ has }\mathcal{P}
\Leftrightarrow
\text{each }Y_i \times_Y X \to Y_i\text{ has }\mathcal{P}.
$$
\end{definition}

\noindent
It is probably best to only consider this notion for properties of morphisms
which are already known to be stable under arbitrary base change (since it is
easy to forget to check the direct implication).

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-descending-properties-morphisms}
Let $S$ be a scheme. Let $\mathcal{P}$ be a property of morphisms of
algebraic spaces over $S$. Assume
\begin{enumerate}
\item if $X_i \to Y_i$, $i = 1, 2$ have property $\mathcal{P}$ so
does $X_1 \amalg X_2 \to Y_1 \amalg Y_2$,
\item a morphism of algebraic spaces $f : X \to Y$ has property
$\mathcal{P}$ if and only if for every affine scheme $Z$ and
morphism $Z \to Y$ the base change $Z \times_Y X \to Z$ of $f$
has property $\mathcal{P}$, and
\item for any surjective flat morphism of affine schemes
$Z' \to Z$ over $S$ and a morphism $f : X \to Z$ from an algebraic space
to $Z$ we have
$$
f' : Z' \times_Z X \to Z'\text{ has }\mathcal{P}
\Rightarrow
f\text{ has }\mathcal{P}.
$$
\end{enumerate}
Then $\mathcal{P}$ is fpqc local on the base.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
If $\mathcal{P}$ has property (2), then it is automatically
stable under any base change. Hence the direct implication in
Definition \ref{definition-property-morphisms-local}.

\medskip\noindent
Let $\{Y_i \to Y\}_{i \in I}$ be an fpqc covering of algebraic spaces over $S$.
Let $f : X \to Y$ be a morphism of algebraic spaces over $S$.
Assume each base change $f_i : Y_i \times_Y X \to Y_i$ has property
$\mathcal{P}$. Our goal is to show that $f$ has $\mathcal{P}$.
Let $Z$ be an affine scheme, and let $Z \to Y$ be a morphism.
By (2) it suffices to show that the morphism of algebraic spaces
$Z \times_Y X \to Z$ has $\mathcal{P}$.
Since $\{Y_i \to Y\}_{i \in I}$ is an fpqc covering we know there
exists a standard fpqc covering $\{Z_j \to Z\}_{j = 1, \ldots , n}$
and morphisms $Z_j \to Y_{i_j}$ over $Y$ for suitable indices $i_j \in I$.
Since $f_{i_j}$ has $\mathcal{P}$ we see that
$$
Z_j \times_Y X
=
Z_j \times_{Y_{i_j}} (Y_{i_j} \times_Y X)
\longrightarrow
Z_j
$$
has $\mathcal{P}$ as a base change of $f_{i_j}$ (see first remark of the
proof). Set $Z' = \coprod_{j = 1, \ldots, n} Z_j$, so that $Z' \to Z$ is
a flat and surjective morphism of affine schemes over $S$. By (1)
we conclude that $Z' \times_Y X \to Z'$ has property $\mathcal{P}$.
Since this is the base change of the morphism $Z \times_Y X \to Z$
by the morphism $Z' \to Z$ we conclude that
$Z \times_Y X \to Z$ has property $\mathcal{P}$ as desired.
\end{proof}


\section{Descending properties of morphisms in the fpqc topology}
\label{section-descending-properties-morphisms-fpqc}


\noindent
In this section we find a large number of properties
of morphisms of algebraic spaces which are local on the base
in the fpqc topology. Please compare with
Descent, Section \ref{descent-section-descending-properties-morphisms-fpqc}
for the case of morphisms of schemes.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-descending-property-quasi-compact}
Let $S$ be a scheme.
The property $\mathcal{P}(f) =$``$f$ is quasi-compact''
is fpqc local on the base on algebraic spaces over $S$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
We will use
Lemma \ref{lemma-descending-properties-morphisms}
to prove this. Assumptions (1) and (2) of that lemma follow from
Morphisms of Spaces,
Lemma \ref{spaces-morphisms-lemma-quasi-compact-local}.
Let $Z' \to Z$ be a surjective flat morphism of affine schemes over $S$.
Let $f : X \to Z$ be a morphism of algebraic spaces, and assume
that the base change $f' : Z' \times_Z X \to Z'$ is quasi-compact. We have
to show that $f$ is quasi-compact. To see this, using
Morphisms of Spaces,
Lemma \ref{spaces-morphisms-lemma-quasi-compact-local}
again, it is enough to show that for every affine scheme $Y$ and
morphism $Y \to Z$ the fibre product $Y \times_Z X$ is quasi-compact.
Here is a picture:
\begin{equation}
\label{equation-cube}
\vcenter{
\xymatrix{
Y \times_Z Z' \times_Z X \ar[dd] \ar[rr] \ar[rd] &&
Z' \times_Z X \ar'[d][dd]^{f'} \ar[rd] \\
& Y \times_Z X \ar[dd] \ar[rr] && X \ar[dd]^f \\
Y \times_Z Z' \ar'[r][rr] \ar[rd] && Z' \ar[rd] \\
& Y \ar[rr] && Z
}
}
\end{equation}
Note that all squares are cartesian and the bottom square consists
of affine schemes. The assumption that $f'$ is quasi-compact combined with
the fact that $Y \times_Z Z'$ is affine implies that
$Y \times_Z Z' \times_Z X$ is quasi-compact. Since
$$
Y \times_Z Z' \times_Z X \longrightarrow Y \times_Z X
$$
is surjective as a base change of $Z' \to Z$
we conclude that $Y \times_Z X$ is quasi-compact, see
Morphisms of Spaces,
Lemma \ref{spaces-morphisms-lemma-surjection-from-quasi-compact}.
This finishes the proof.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-descending-property-quasi-separated}
Let $S$ be a scheme.
The property $\mathcal{P}(f) =$``$f$ is quasi-separated''
is fpqc local on the base on algebraic spaces over $S$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
A base change of a quasi-separated morphism is quasi-separated, see
Morphisms of Spaces,
Lemma \ref{spaces-morphisms-lemma-base-change-separated}.
Hence the direct implication in
Definition \ref{definition-property-morphisms-local}.

\medskip\noindent
Let $\{Y_i \to Y\}_{i \in I}$ be an fpqc covering of algebraic spaces over $S$.
Let $f : X \to Y$ be a morphism of algebraic spaces over $S$.
Assume each base change $X_i := Y_i \times_Y X \to Y_i$ is quasi-separated.
This means that each of the morphisms
$$
\Delta_i :
X_i
\longrightarrow
X_i \times_{Y_i} X_i = Y_i \times_Y (X \times_Y X)
$$
is quasi-compact. The base change of a fpqc covering is an fpqc covering, see
Topologies on Spaces, Lemma \ref{spaces-topologies-lemma-fpqc}
hence $\{Y_i \times_Y (X \times_Y X) \to X \times_Y X\}$
is an fpqc covering of algebraic spaces. Moreover, each
$\Delta_i$ is the base change of the morphism
$\Delta : X \to X \times_Y X$. Hence it follows from
Lemma \ref{lemma-descending-property-quasi-compact}
that $\Delta$ is quasi-compact, i.e., $f$ is quasi-separated.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-descending-property-universally-closed}
Let $S$ be a scheme.
The property $\mathcal{P}(f) =$``$f$ is universally closed''
is fpqc local on the base on algebraic spaces over $S$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
We will use
Lemma \ref{lemma-descending-properties-morphisms}
to prove this. Assumptions (1) and (2) of that lemma follow from
Morphisms of Spaces,
Lemma \ref{spaces-morphisms-lemma-universally-closed-local}.
Let $Z' \to Z$ be a surjective flat morphism of affine schemes over $S$.
Let $f : X \to Z$ be a morphism of algebraic spaces, and assume
that the base change $f' : Z' \times_Z X \to Z'$ is universally closed.
We have to show that $f$ is universally closed. To see this, using
Morphisms of Spaces,
Lemma \ref{spaces-morphisms-lemma-universally-closed-local}
again, it is enough to show that for every affine scheme $Y$ and
morphism $Y \to Z$ the map $|Y \times_Z X| \to |Y|$ is closed.
Consider the cube (\ref{equation-cube}).
The assumption that $f'$ is universally closed implies that
$|Y \times_Z Z' \times_Z X| \to |Y \times_Z Z'|$ is closed.
As $Y \times_Z Z' \to Y$ is surjective and flat as a base change of $Z' \to Z$
we see the map $|Y \times_Z Z'| \to |Y|$ is submersive, see
Morphisms, Lemma \ref{morphisms-lemma-fpqc-quotient-topology}.
Moreover the map
$$
|Y \times_Z Z' \times_Z X|
\longrightarrow
|Y \times_Z Z'| \times_{|Y|} |Y \times_Z X|
$$
is surjective, see
Properties of Spaces, Lemma \ref{spaces-properties-lemma-points-cartesian}.
It follows by elementary topology that $|Y \times_Z X| \to |Y|$ is closed.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-descending-property-universally-open}
Let $S$ be a scheme.
The property $\mathcal{P}(f) =$``$f$ is universally open''
is fpqc local on the base on algebraic spaces over $S$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
The proof is the same as the proof of
Lemma \ref{lemma-descending-property-universally-closed}.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-descending-property-surjective}
The property $\mathcal{P}(f) =$``$f$ is surjective''
is fpqc local on the base.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Omitted. (Hint: Use
Properties of Spaces, Lemma \ref{spaces-properties-lemma-points-cartesian}.)
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-descending-property-radicial}
The property $\mathcal{P}(f) =$``$f$ is radicial''
is fpqc local on the base.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
We will use
Lemma \ref{lemma-descending-properties-morphisms}
to prove this. Assumptions (1) and (2) of that lemma follow from
Morphisms of Spaces,
Lemma \ref{spaces-morphisms-lemma-universally-closed-local}.
Let $Z' \to Z$ be a flat surjective morphism of affine schemes
over $S$ and let $f : X \to Z$ be a morphism from an algebraic space to $Z$.
Assume that the base change $f' : X' \to Z'$ is radicial.
Let $K$ be a field, and let $a, b : \text{Spec}(K) \to X$
be two morphisms such that $f \circ a = f \circ b$.
As $Z' \to Z$ is surjective there exists a field
extension $K \subset K'$ and a morphism
$\text{Spec}(K') \to Z'$
such that the following solid diagram commutes
$$
\xymatrix{
\text{Spec}(K') \ar[rrd] \ar@{-->}[rd]_{a', b'} \ar[dd] \\
 &
X' \ar[r] \ar[d] &
Z' \ar[d] \\
\text{Spec}(K) \ar[r]^{a, b} &
X \ar[r] &
Z
}
$$
As the square is cartesian we get the two dotted arrows $a'$, $b'$ making the
diagram commute. Since $X' \to Z'$ is radicial we get $a' = b'$.
This forces $a = b$ as $\{\text{Spec}(K') \to \text{Spec}(K)\}$
is an fpqc covering, see
Properties of Spaces, Lemma \ref{spaces-properties-lemma-separated-fpqc}.
Hence $f$ is radicial as desired.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-descending-property-locally-finite-type}
The property $\mathcal{P}(f) =$``$f$ is locally of finite type''
is fpqc local on the base.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
We will use
Lemma \ref{lemma-descending-properties-morphisms}
to prove this. Assumptions (1) and (2) of that lemma follow from
Morphisms of Spaces,
Lemma \ref{spaces-morphisms-lemma-finite-type-local}.
Let $Z' \to Z$ be a surjective flat morphism of affine schemes over $S$.
Let $f : X \to Z$ be a morphism of algebraic spaces, and assume
that the base change $f' : Z' \times_Z X \to Z'$ is locally of finite type.
We have to show that $f$ is locally of finite type. Let $U$ be a scheme
and let $U \to X$ be surjective and etale. By
Morphisms of Spaces,
Lemma \ref{spaces-morphisms-lemma-finite-type-local}
again, it is enough to show that $U \to Z$ is locally of finite type.
Since $f'$ is locally of finite type, and since $Z' \times_Z U$ is a
scheme etale over $Z' \times_Z X$ we conclude (by the same lemma again) that
$Z' \times_Z U \to Z'$ is locally of finite type.
As $\{Z' \to Z\}$ is an fpqc covering we conclude that
$U \to Z$ is locally of finite type by
Descent, Lemma \ref{descent-lemma-descending-property-locally-finite-type}
as desired.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-descending-property-locally-finite-presentation}
The property $\mathcal{P}(f) =$``$f$ is locally of finite presentation''
is fpqc local on the base.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
We will use
Lemma \ref{lemma-descending-properties-morphisms}
to prove this. Assumptions (1) and (2) of that lemma follow from
Morphisms of Spaces,
Lemma \ref{spaces-morphisms-lemma-finite-presentation-local}.
Let $Z' \to Z$ be a surjective flat morphism of affine schemes over $S$.
Let $f : X \to Z$ be a morphism of algebraic spaces, and assume
that the base change $f' : Z' \times_Z X \to Z'$ is locally of
finite presentation.
We have to show that $f$ is locally of finite presentation. Let $U$ be a scheme
and let $U \to X$ be surjective and etale. By
Morphisms of Spaces,
Lemma \ref{spaces-morphisms-lemma-finite-presentation-local}
again, it is enough to show that $U \to Z$ is locally of finite presentation.
Since $f'$ is locally of finite presentation, and since $Z' \times_Z U$ is a
scheme etale over $Z' \times_Z X$ we conclude (by the same lemma again) that
$Z' \times_Z U \to Z'$ is locally of finite presentation.
As $\{Z' \to Z\}$ is an fpqc covering we conclude that
$U \to Z$ is locally of finite presentation by
Descent,
Lemma \ref{descent-lemma-descending-property-locally-finite-presentation}
as desired.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-descending-property-finite-type}
The property $\mathcal{P}(f) =$``$f$ is of finite type''
is fpqc local on the base.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Combine Lemmas \ref{lemma-descending-property-quasi-compact}
and \ref{lemma-descending-property-locally-finite-type}.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-descending-property-finite-presentation}
The property $\mathcal{P}(f) =$``$f$ is of finite presentation''
is fpqc local on the base.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Combine Lemmas \ref{lemma-descending-property-quasi-compact},
\ref{lemma-descending-property-quasi-separated} and
\ref{lemma-descending-property-locally-finite-presentation}.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-descending-property-flat}
The property $\mathcal{P}(f) =$``$f$ is flat''
is fpqc local on the base.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
We will use
Lemma \ref{lemma-descending-properties-morphisms}
to prove this. Assumptions (1) and (2) of that lemma follow from
Morphisms of Spaces,
Lemma \ref{spaces-morphisms-lemma-flat-local}.
Let $Z' \to Z$ be a surjective flat morphism of affine schemes over $S$.
Let $f : X \to Z$ be a morphism of algebraic spaces, and assume
that the base change $f' : Z' \times_Z X \to Z'$ is flat.
We have to show that $f$ is flat. Let $U$ be a scheme
and let $U \to X$ be surjective and etale. By
Morphisms of Spaces,
Lemma \ref{spaces-morphisms-lemma-flat-local}
again, it is enough to show that $U \to Z$ is flat.
Since $f'$ is flat, and since $Z' \times_Z U$ is a
scheme etale over $Z' \times_Z X$ we conclude (by the same lemma again) that
$Z' \times_Z U \to Z'$ is flat.
As $\{Z' \to Z\}$ is an fpqc covering we conclude that
$U \to Z$ is flat by
Descent, Lemma \ref{descent-lemma-descending-property-flat}
as desired.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-descending-property-open-immersion}
The property $\mathcal{P}(f) =$``$f$ is an open immersion''
is fpqc local on the base.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
We will use
Lemma \ref{lemma-descending-properties-morphisms}
to prove this. Assumptions (1) and (2) of that lemma follow from
Morphisms of Spaces,
Lemma \ref{spaces-morphisms-lemma-closed-immersion-local}.
Consider a cartesian diagram
$$
\xymatrix{
X' \ar[r] \ar[d] & X \ar[d] \\
Z' \ar[r] & Z
}
$$
of algebraic spaces over $S$
where $Z' \to Z$ is a surjective flat morphism of affine schemes,
and $X' \to Z'$ is an open immersion. We have to show that $X \to Z$
is an open immersion. Note that $|X'| \subset |Z'|$ corresponds to an
open subscheme $U' \subset Z'$ (isomorphic to $X'$)
with the property that $\text{pr}_0^{-1}(U') = \text{pr}_1^{-1}(U')$
as open subschemes of $Z' \times_Z Z'$. Hence there exists an open
subscheme $U \subset Z$ such that $X' = (Z' \to Z)^{-1}(U)$, see
Descent, Lemma \ref{descent-lemma-open-fpqc-covering}.
As $X' \to Z'$ is quasi-separated also $X \to Z$ is quasi-separated, by
Lemma \ref{lemma-descending-property-quasi-separated}.
Hence $X$ is quasi-separated over $S$ (since $Z$ is affine, hence separated,
hence $Z \to S$ is separated, hence $X \to Z \to S$ is quasi-separated by
Morphisms of Spaces, Lemma \ref{spaces-morphisms-lemma-composition-separated}).
Thus by
Properties of Spaces,
Lemma \ref{spaces-properties-lemma-sheaf-fpqc-quasi-separated}
we see that $X$ satisfies the sheaf condition for the fpqc topology.
Now we have the fpqc covering $\mathcal{U} = \{U' \to U\}$
and the element $U' \to X' \to X \in \check{H}^0(\mathcal{U}, X)$.
By the sheaf condition we obtain a morphism $U \to X$ such that
$$
\xymatrix{
U' \ar[r] \ar[d]^{\cong} \ar@/_3ex/[dd] & U \ar[d] \ar@/^3ex/[dd] \\
X' \ar[r] \ar[d] & X \ar[d] \\
Z' \ar[r] & Z
}
$$
is commutative. On the other hand, we know that for any scheme $T$ pver $S$
and $T$-valued point $T \to X$ the composition $T \to X \to Z$ is a
morphism such that $Z' \times_Z T \to Z'$ factors through $U'$. Clearly
this means that $T \to Z$ factors through $U$. In other words the map
of sheaves $U \to X$ is bijective and we win.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-descending-property-isomorphism}
The property $\mathcal{P}(f) =$``$f$ is an isomorphism''
is fpqc local on the base.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Combine Lemmas \ref{lemma-descending-property-surjective}
and \ref{lemma-descending-property-open-immersion}.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-descending-property-affine}
The property $\mathcal{P}(f) =$``$f$ is affine''
is fpqc local on the base.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
We will use
Lemma \ref{lemma-descending-properties-morphisms}
to prove this. Assumptions (1) and (2) of that lemma follow from
Morphisms of Spaces,
Lemma \ref{spaces-morphisms-lemma-affine-local}.
Let $Z' \to Z$ be a surjective flat morphism of affine schemes over $S$.
Let $f : X \to Z$ be a morphism of algebraic spaces, and assume
that the base change $f' : Z' \times_Z X \to Z'$ is affine.
This implies that $Z' \times_Z X$ is representable, and
that $Z' \times_Z X \to Z'$ is quasi-separated. Hence we conclude
that $X \to Z$ is quasi-separated by
Lemma \ref{lemma-descending-property-quasi-separated}.
In particular $X$ is quasi-separated over $S$, and satisfies the
sheaf condition for the fpqc topology, see
Properties of Spaces,
Lemma \ref{spaces-properties-lemma-sheaf-fpqc-quasi-separated}.

\medskip\noindent
Let $X'$ be a scheme representing $Z' \times_Z X$.
We obtain a canonical isomorphism
$$
\varphi : X' \times_Z Z' \longrightarrow Z' \times_Z X'
$$
since both schemes represent the algebraic space $Z' \times_Z Z' \times_Z X$.
This is a descent datum for $X'/Z'/Z$, see
Descent, Definition \ref{descent-definition-descent-datum}
(verification omitted, compare with
Descent, Lemma \ref{descent-lemma-descent-data-sheaves}).
Since $X' \to Z'$ is affine this descent datum is effective, see
Descent, Lemma \ref{descent-lemma-affine}.
Thus there exists a scheme $Y \to Z$ over $Z$ and an
isomorphism $\psi : Z' \times_Z Y \to X'$ compatible with descent data.
Of course $Y \to Z$ is affine (by construction or by
Descent, Lemma \ref{descent-lemma-descending-property-affine}).
Note that $\mathcal{Y} = \{Z' \times_Z Y \to Y\}$ is a
fpqc covering, and interpreting $\psi$ as an element of
$X(Z' \times_Z Y)$ we see that $\psi \in \check{H}^0(\mathcal{Y}, X)$.
By the sheaf condition for $X$ (see above) we obtain a morphism $Y \to X$.
By construction the base change of this to $Z'$ is an isomorphism, hence
an isomorphism by
Lemma \ref{lemma-descending-property-isomorphism}.
This proves that $X$ is representable by an affine scheme and we win.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-descending-property-closed-immersion}
The property $\mathcal{P}(f) =$``$f$ is a closed immersion''
is fpqc local on the base.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
We will use
Lemma \ref{lemma-descending-properties-morphisms}
to prove this. Assumptions (1) and (2) of that lemma follow from
Morphisms of Spaces,
Lemma \ref{spaces-morphisms-lemma-closed-immersion-local}.
Consider a cartesian diagram
$$
\xymatrix{
X' \ar[r] \ar[d] & X \ar[d] \\
Z' \ar[r] & Z
}
$$
of algebraic spaces over $S$
where $Z' \to Z$ is a surjective flat morphism of affine schemes,
and $X' \to Z'$ is a closed immersion. We have to show that $X \to Z$
is a closed immersion. The morphism $X' \to Z'$ is affine. Hence by
Lemma \ref{lemma-descending-property-affine}
we see that $X$ is a scheme and $X \to Z$ is affine.
It follows from
Descent, Lemma \ref{descent-lemma-descending-property-closed-immersion}
that $X \to Z$ is a closed immersion as desired.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-descending-property-separated}
The property $\mathcal{P}(f) =$``$f$ is separated''
is fpqc local on the base.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
A base change of a separated morphism is separated, see
Morphisms of Spaces,
Lemma \ref{spaces-morphisms-lemma-base-change-separated}.
Hence the direct implication in
Definition \ref{definition-property-morphisms-local}.

\medskip\noindent
Let $\{Y_i \to Y\}_{i \in I}$ be an fpqc covering of algebraic spaces over $S$.
Let $f : X \to Y$ be a morphism of algebraic spaces over $S$.
Assume each base change $X_i := Y_i \times_Y X \to Y_i$ is separated.
This means that each of the morphisms
$$
\Delta_i :
X_i
\longrightarrow
X_i \times_{Y_i} X_i = Y_i \times_Y (X \times_Y X)
$$
is a closed immersion. The base change of a fpqc covering is an
fpqc covering, see
Topologies on Spaces, Lemma \ref{spaces-topologies-lemma-fpqc}
hence $\{Y_i \times_Y (X \times_Y X) \to X \times_Y X\}$
is an fpqc covering of algebraic spaces. Moreover, each
$\Delta_i$ is the base change of the morphism
$\Delta : X \to X \times_Y X$. Hence it follows from
Lemma \ref{lemma-descending-property-closed-immersion}
that $\Delta$ is a closed immersion, i.e., $f$ is separated.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-descending-property-proper}
The property $\mathcal{P}(f) =$``$f$ is proper''
is fpqc local on the base.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
The lemma follows by combining
Lemmas \ref{lemma-descending-property-universally-closed},
\ref{lemma-descending-property-separated}
and \ref{lemma-descending-property-finite-type}.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-descending-property-quasi-affine}
The property $\mathcal{P}(f) =$``$f$ is quasi-affine''
is fpqc local on the base.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
We will use
Lemma \ref{lemma-descending-properties-morphisms}
to prove this. Assumptions (1) and (2) of that lemma follow from
Morphisms of Spaces,
Lemma \ref{spaces-morphisms-lemma-quasi-affine-local}.
Let $Z' \to Z$ be a surjective flat morphism of affine schemes over $S$.
Let $f : X \to Z$ be a morphism of algebraic spaces, and assume
that the base change $f' : Z' \times_Z X \to Z'$ is quasi-affine.
This implies that $Z' \times_Z X$ is representable, and
that $Z' \times_Z X \to Z'$ is quasi-separated. Hence we conclude
that $X \to Z$ is quasi-separated by
Lemma \ref{lemma-descending-property-quasi-separated}.
In particular $X$ is quasi-separated over $S$, and satisfies the
sheaf condition for the fpqc topology, see
Properties of Spaces,
Lemma \ref{spaces-properties-lemma-sheaf-fpqc-quasi-separated}.

\medskip\noindent
Let $X'$ be a scheme representing $Z' \times_Z X$.
We obtain a canonical isomorphism
$$
\varphi : X' \times_Z Z' \longrightarrow Z' \times_Z X'
$$
since both schemes represent the algebraic space $Z' \times_Z Z' \times_Z X$.
This is a descent datum for $X'/Z'/Z$, see
Descent, Definition \ref{descent-definition-descent-datum}
(verification omitted, compare with
Descent, Lemma \ref{descent-lemma-descent-data-sheaves}).
Since $X' \to Z'$ is quasi-affine this descent datum is effective, see
Descent, Lemma \ref{descent-lemma-quasi-affine}.
Thus there exists a scheme $Y \to Z$ over $Z$ and an
isomorphism $\psi : Z' \times_Z Y \to X'$ compatible with descent data.
Of course $Y \to Z$ is quasi-affine (by construction or by
Descent, Lemma \ref{descent-lemma-descending-property-quasi-affine}).
Note that $\mathcal{Y} = \{Z' \times_Z Y \to Y\}$ is a
fpqc covering, and interpreting $\psi$ as an element of
$X(Z' \times_Z Y)$ we see that $\psi \in \check{H}^0(\mathcal{Y}, X)$.
By the sheaf condition for $X$ (see above) we obtain a morphism $Y \to X$.
By construction the base change of this to $Z'$ is an isomorphism, hence
an isomorphism by
Lemma \ref{lemma-descending-property-isomorphism}.
This proves that $X$ is representable by a quasi-affine scheme and we win.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-descending-property-quasi-compact-immersion}
The property $\mathcal{P}(f) =$``$f$ is a quasi-compact immersion''
is fpqc local on the base.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
We will use
Lemma \ref{lemma-descending-properties-morphisms}
to prove this. Assumptions (1) and (2) of that lemma follow from
Morphisms of Spaces,
Lemmas \ref{spaces-morphisms-lemma-closed-immersion-local} and
\ref{spaces-morphisms-lemma-quasi-compact-local}.
Consider a cartesian diagram
$$
\xymatrix{
X' \ar[r] \ar[d] & X \ar[d] \\
Z' \ar[r] & Z
}
$$
of algebraic spaces over $S$
where $Z' \to Z$ is a surjective flat morphism of affine schemes,
and $X' \to Z'$ is a quasi-compact immersion. We have to show that $X \to Z$
is a closed immersion. The morphism $X' \to Z'$ is quasi-affine. Hence by
Lemma \ref{lemma-descending-property-quasi-affine}
we see that $X$ is a scheme and $X \to Z$ is quasi-affine.
It follows from
Descent, Lemma \ref{descent-lemma-descending-property-quasi-compact-immersion}
that $X \to Z$ is a quasi-compact immersion as desired.
\end{proof}




\section{Descending properties of morphisms in the fppf topology}
\label{section-descending-properties-morphisms-fppf}

\noindent
In this section we find some properties of morphisms of schemes
for which we could not (yet) show they are local on the base in
the fpqc topology which, however, are local on the base
in the fppf topology.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-descending-fppf-property-locally-separated}
The property $\mathcal{P}(f) =$``$f$ is locally separated''
is fppf local on the base.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
FIXME: We will prove this after we have proved that ``$f$ is an immersion''
is fppf local on the base.
\end{proof}
