\section{Introduction}
\label{section-introduction}

\noindent
In this chapter we write about cohomology of algebraic stacks.
This mean in particular cohomology of quasi-coherent sheaves, i.e.,
we prove analogues of the results in the chapter entitled
``Coherent Cohomology''. The results in this chapter are different
from those in \cite{LM-B} mainly because we consistently use the
``big sites''. Before reading this chapter please take a quick look at
the chapter ``Sheaves on Algebraic Stacks'' in order to become
familiar with the terminology introduced there.






\section{Conventions and abuse of language}
\label{section-conventions}

\noindent
We continue to use the conventions and the abuse of language
introduced in
Properties of Stacks, Section \ref{stacks-properties-section-conventions}.








\section{Notation}
\label{section-notation}

\noindent
Different topologies. If we indicate an algebraic stack by a calligraphic
letter, such as $\mathcal{X}, \mathcal{Y}, \mathcal{Z}$, then the notation
$\mathcal{X}_{Zar}, \mathcal{X}_{\acute{e}tale}, \mathcal{X}_{smooth},
\mathcal{X}_{syntomic}, \mathcal{X}_{fppf}$ indicates the site introduced
in
Sheaves on Stacks, Definition
\ref{stacks-sheaves-definition-inherited-topologies}.
(Think ``big site''.) Correspondingly the structure sheaf of
$\mathcal{X}$ is a sheaf on $\mathcal{X}_{fppf}$.
On the other hand, algebraic spaces and schemes
are usually indicated by roman capitals, such as $X, Y, Z$, and in this case
$X_{\acute{e}tale}$ indicates the small \'etale site of $X$ (as
defined in
Topologies, Definition
\ref{topologies-definition-big-small-etale}
or
Properties of Spaces, Definition
\ref{spaces-properties-definition-etale-site}).
It seems that the distinction should be clear enough.
