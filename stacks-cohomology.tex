\section{Introduction}
\label{section-introduction}

\noindent
In this chapter we write about cohomology of algebraic stacks.
This mean in particular cohomology of quasi-coherent sheaves, i.e.,
we prove analogues of the results in the chapter entitled
``Coherent Cohomology''. The results in this chapter are different
from those in \cite{LM-B} mainly because we consistently use the
``big sites''. Before reading this chapter please take a quick look at
the chapter ``Sheaves on Algebraic Stacks'' in order to become
familiar with the terminology introduced there.

\medskip\noindent
Let $f : \mathcal{X} \to \mathcal{Y}$ be a quasi-compact and
quasi-separated morphism of algebraic stacks. In general it is not true that
$f_*$ transforms quasi-coherent $\mathcal{O}_\mathcal{X}$-modules
into quasi-coherent $\mathcal{O}_\mathcal{Y}$-modules. Here are
three key observations that will allows us to get a good theory anyway:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $f_*$ does preserve the category of locally quasi-coherent modules, and
\item $f_*$ transforms a quasi-coherent sheaf into a locally quasi-coherent
sheaf whose comparison maps, see
Sheaves on Stacks, Equation (\ref{stacks-sheaves-equation-comparison-modules})
are isomorphisms for maps $\varphi$ lying over flat maps, and
\item locally quasi-coherent $\mathcal{O}_\mathcal{Y}$-modules as in (2)
give rise to modules on a presentation of $\mathcal{Y}$ and hence
quasi-coherent modules on $\mathcal{Y}$, see
Sheaves on Stacks, Section
\ref{stacks-sheaves-section-quasi-coherent-algebraic-stacks}.
\end{enumerate}
Once we have worked out the details, we will obtain a functor
$f_{QCoh, *} : \textit{QCoh}(\mathcal{O}_\mathcal{X})
\to \textit{QCoh}(\mathcal{O}_\mathcal{Y})$ adjoint to $f^*$.
Moreover, a similar construction will produce functors $R^if_*$.
However, these results will not be sufficient to produce a
total direct image functor (of complexes with quasi-coherent
cohomology sheaves).




\section{Conventions and abuse of language}
\label{section-conventions}

\noindent
We continue to use the conventions and the abuse of language
introduced in
Properties of Stacks, Section \ref{stacks-properties-section-conventions}.








\section{Notation}
\label{section-notation}

\noindent
Different topologies. If we indicate an algebraic stack by a calligraphic
letter, such as $\mathcal{X}, \mathcal{Y}, \mathcal{Z}$, then the notation
$\mathcal{X}_{Zar}, \mathcal{X}_{\acute{e}tale}, \mathcal{X}_{smooth},
\mathcal{X}_{syntomic}, \mathcal{X}_{fppf}$ indicates the site introduced
in
Sheaves on Stacks, Definition
\ref{stacks-sheaves-definition-inherited-topologies}.
(Think ``big site''.) Correspondingly the structure sheaf of
$\mathcal{X}$ is a sheaf on $\mathcal{X}_{fppf}$.
On the other hand, algebraic spaces and schemes
are usually indicated by roman capitals, such as $X, Y, Z$, and in this case
$X_{\acute{e}tale}$ indicates the small \'etale site of $X$ (as
defined in
Topologies, Definition
\ref{topologies-definition-big-small-etale}
or
Properties of Spaces, Definition
\ref{spaces-properties-definition-etale-site}).
It seems that the distinction should be clear enough.

\medskip\noindent
The default topology is the fppf topology. Hence we will sometimes
say ``sheaf on $\mathcal{X}$'' or ``sheaf of $\mathcal{O}_\mathcal{X}$''
modules when we mean sheaf on $\mathcal{X}_{fppf}$ or object of
$\textit{Mod}(\mathcal{X}_{fppf}, \mathcal{O}_\mathcal{X})$.

\medskip\noindent
If $f : \mathcal{X} \to \mathcal{Y}$ is a morphism of algebraic
stacks, then the functors $f_*$ and $f^{-1}$ defined on presheaves
preserves sheaves for any of the topologies mentioned above. In particular
when we discuss the pushforward or pullback of a sheaf we don't have to
mention which topology we are working with. The same isn't true
when we compute cohomology groups and/or higher direct images. In this
case we will always mention which topology we are working with.

\medskip\noindent
Suppose that $f : X \to \mathcal{Y}$ is a morphism from an algebraic
space $X$ to an algebraic stack $\mathcal{Y}$. Let $\mathcal{G}$ be
a sheaf on $\mathcal{Y}_\tau$ for some topology $\tau$. In this case
$f^{-1}\mathcal{G}$ is a sheaf for the $\tau$ topology on $\mathcal{S}_X$
(the algebraic stack associated to $X$) because (by our conventions) $f$
really is a $1$-morphism $f : \mathcal{S}_X \to \mathcal{Y}$.
If $\tau = \acute{e}tale$ or stronger, then we write
$f^{-1}\mathcal{G}|_{X_{\acute{e}tale}}$
to denote the restriction to the \'etale site of $X$, see
Sheaves on Stacks, Section \ref{stacks-sheaves-section-compare}.
If $\mathcal{G}$ is an $\mathcal{O}_\mathcal{X}$-module we sometimes
write $f^*\mathcal{G}$ and $f^*\mathcal{G}|_{X_{\acute{e}tale}}$
instead.




\section{Locally quasi-coherent modules}
\label{section-locally-quasi-coherent}

\noindent
Let $\mathcal{X}$ be an algebraic stack. In
Sheaves on Stacks, Definition
\ref{stacks-sheaves-definition-locally-quasi-coherent}
we have defined the notion of a locally quasi-coherent
$\mathcal{O}_\mathcal{X}$-module $\mathcal{F}$. Briefly, this means
$\mathcal{F}$ is an $\mathcal{O}_\mathcal{X}$-module for the
\'etale topology such that for any morphism $f : U \to \mathcal{X}$
the restriction $f^*\mathcal{F}|_{U_{\acute{e}tale}}$ is quasi-coherent
on $U$. (The actual definition is slightly different, but equivalent.)
A useful fact is that
$$
\textit{LQCoh}(\mathcal{O}_\mathcal{X}) \subset
\textit{Mod}(\mathcal{X}_{\acute{e}tale}, \mathcal{O}_\mathcal{X})
$$
is a Serre subcategory, see
Sheaves on Stacks, Lemma \ref{stacks-sheaves-lemma-lqc-colimits}.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-check-lqc-on-etale-covering}
Let $\mathcal{X}$ be an algebraic stack. Let
$f_j : \mathcal{X}_j \to \mathcal{X}$ be a family of smooth
morphisms of algebraic stacks with
$|\mathcal{X}| =\bigcup |f_j|(|\mathcal{X}_j|)$.
Let $\mathcal{F}$ be a sheaf of $\mathcal{O}_\mathcal{X}$ modules
on $\mathcal{X}_{\acute{e}tale}$. If each $f_j^{-1}\mathcal{F}$
is locally quasi-coherent, then so is $\mathcal{F}$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
We may replace each of the algebraic stacks $\mathcal{X}_j$ by
a scheme $U_j$ (using that any algebraic stack has a smooth covering by
a scheme and that compositions of smooth morphisms are smooth, see
Morphisms of Stacks, Lemma \ref{stacks-morphisms-lemma-composition-smooth}).
The pullback of $\mathcal{F}$ to $(\Sch/U_j)_{\acute{e}tale}$ is still
locally quasi-coherent, see
Sheaves on Stacks, Lemma \ref{stacks-sheaves-lemma-pullback-lqc}.
Then $\coprod f_j : U = \coprod U_j \to \mathcal{X}$ is a smooth surjective
morphism. Let $x$ be an object of $\mathcal{X}$. By
Sheaves on Stacks, Lemma
\ref{stacks-sheaves-lemma-surjective-flat-locally-finite-presentation}
there exists an \'etale covering $\{x_i \to x\}_{i \in I}$
such that each $x_i$ lifts to an object $u_i$ of $(\Sch/U)_{\acute{e}tale}$.
This just means that $x$, $x_i$ live over a schemes $V$, $V_i$, that
$\{V_i \to V\}$ is an \'etale covering, and that $x_i$ comes from
a morphism $u_i : V_i \to U$. The restriction
$x_i^*\mathcal{F}|_{V_{i, \acute{e}tale}}$ is equal to the restriction
of $g^*\mathcal{F}$ to $V_{i, \acute{e}tale}$ (by compatibility of
pullback with composition). Hence $x^*\mathcal{F}|_{V_{\acute{e}tale}}$
is a sheaf on the small \'etale site of $V$ which is quasi-coherent
when restricted to $V_{i, \acute{e}tale}$ for each $i$.
This implies that it is quasi-coherent (as desired), for example by
Properties of Spaces, Lemma
\ref{spaces-properties-lemma-characterize-quasi-coherent}.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-pushforward-locally-quasi-coherent}
Let $g : \mathcal{X} \to \mathcal{Y}$ be a quasi-compact and
quasi-separated morphism of algebraic stacks. Let 
$\mathcal{F}$ be a locally quasi-coherent
$\mathcal{O}_\mathcal{X}$-module. Then $R^ig_*\mathcal{F}$
(computed in the \'etale topology) is
a locally quasi-coherent $\mathcal{O}_\mathcal{Y}$-module.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
By
Sheaves on Stacks, Lemma
\ref{stacks-sheaves-lemma-base-change-higher-direct-images}
taking higher direct images commutes with base change.
Hence using
Lemma \ref{lemma-check-lqc-on-etale-covering}
we may assume that $\mathcal{Y}$ is representable by a scheme.
Using the same lemma once more, we see that
the question is Zariski local on $\mathcal{Y}$, hence we may assume that
$\mathcal{Y}$ is representable by an affine scheme. Since $g$ is
quasi-compact this implies that also $\mathcal{X}$ is quasi-compact.
Thus we may choose a surjective smooth morphism
$f : \mathcal{U} \to \mathcal{X}$ where $\mathcal{U}$ is representable
by an affine scheme.

\medskip\noindent
In this situation we have the spectral sequence
$$
E_2^{p, q} = R^q(g \circ f_p)_*f_p^{-1}\mathcal{F}
\Rightarrow
R^{p + q}g_*\mathcal{F}
$$
of
Sheaves on Stacks, Proposition
\ref{stacks-sheaves-proposition-smooth-covering-compute-direct-image}.
Since $\textit{LQCoh}(\mathcal{O}_\mathcal{Y})$ is a Serre subcategory
of
$\textit{Mod}(\mathcal{Y}_{\acute{e}tale}, \mathcal{O}_\mathcal{Y})$
(see
Sheaves on Stacks, Lemma \ref{stacks-sheaves-lemma-lqc-colimits})
it suffices to prove that the higher direct images of a locally
quasi-coherent module under the morphisms
$$
\mathcal{U}_n =
\mathcal{U} \times_\mathcal{X} \ldots \times_\mathcal{X} \mathcal{U}
\longrightarrow
\mathcal{Y}
$$
are locally quasi-coherent. The algebraic spaces $\mathcal{U}_n$
are quasi-compact and quasi-separated by
Morphisms of Stacks, Lemma
\ref{stacks-morphisms-lemma-quasi-compact-quasi-separated-permanence}.
This reduces us to the case where $g : \mathcal{X} \to \mathcal{Y}$
is representable by algebraic spaces.

\medskip\noindent
In case $f$ is quasi-compact, quasi-separated, and representable by algebraic
spaces, choose any object $y$ of $\mathcal{Y}$ lying over a scheme $V$.
Consider the cartesian diagram
$$
\xymatrix{
Z \ar[d] \ar[r]_q \ar[d]_p & \mathcal{X} \ar[d]^f \\
V \ar[r]^y & \mathcal{Y}
}
$$
Thus $Z$ is an algebraic space and $p$ is quasi-compact and quasi-separated.
By base change (see
Sheaves on Stacks, Lemma
\ref{stacks-sheaves-lemma-base-change-higher-direct-images})
combined with
Sheaves on Stacks, Lemma \ref{stacks-sheaves-lemma-compare-morphism-cohomology}
we have
$$
R^if_*\mathcal{F}|_{V_{\acute{e}tale}} =
R^ip_{small, *}\big((q^*\mathcal{F})|_{Z_{\acute{e}tale}}\big)
$$
Hence the left hand side is a quasi-coherent sheaf on $V_{\acute{e}tale}$
by Cohomology on Spaces, Lemma
\ref{spaces-cohomology-lemma-higher-direct-image}.
\end{proof}
