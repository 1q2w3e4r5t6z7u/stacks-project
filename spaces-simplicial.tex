\section{Introduction}
\label{section-introduction}

\noindent
This chapter develops some theory concerning simplicial topological spaces,
simplicial ringed spaces, simplicial schemes, and simplicial algebraic spaces.
The theory of simplicial spaces sometimes allows one to prove local to global
principles which appear difficult to prove in other ways.
Some example applications can be found in the papers
\cite{faltings_finiteness}, \cite{Kiehl}, and \cite{HodgeIII}.



\section{Conventions}
\label{section-conventions}

\noindent
The standing assumption is that all schemes are contained in
a big fppf site $\Sch_{fppf}$. And all rings $A$ considered
have the property that $\Spec(A)$ is (isomorphic) to an
object of this big site.

\medskip\noindent
Let $S$ be a scheme and let $X$ be an algebraic space over $S$.
In this chapter and the following we will write $X \times_S X$
for the product of $X$ with itself (in the category of algebraic
spaces over $S$), instead of $X \times X$.

\medskip\noindent
We continue our convention to label projection maps starting with
index $0$, so we have $\text{pr}_0 : X \times_S Y \to X$ and
$\text{pr}_1 : X \times_S Y \to Y$.
