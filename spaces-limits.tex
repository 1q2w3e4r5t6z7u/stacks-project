\section{Introduction}
\label{section-introduction}

\noindent
In this chapter we work out absolute Noetherian approximation for
quasi-compact and quasi-separated algebraic spaces following
\cite{CLO}. Another approach is due to David Rydh (see
\cite{rydh_approx}) whose results
also cover absolute Noetherian approximation for certain algebraic stacks.


\section{Conventions}
\label{section-conventions}

\noindent
The standing assumption is that all schemes are contained in
a big fppf site $\Sch_{fppf}$. And all rings $A$ considered
have the property that $\Spec(A)$ is (isomorphic) to an
object of this big site.

\medskip\noindent
Let $S$ be a scheme and let $X$ be an algebraic space over $S$.
In this chapter and the following we will write $X \times_S X$
for the product of $X$ with itself (in the category of algebraic
spaces over $S$), instead of $X \times X$.




\section{Directed limits of algebraic spaces with affine transition maps}
\label{section-limits}

\noindent
The following lemma explains how we think of limits of algebraic
spaces in this chapter. We will use (without further mention) that the
base change of an affine morphism of algebraic spaces is affine (see
Morphisms of Spaces, Lemma \ref{spaces-morphisms-lemma-base-change-affine}).

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-directed-inverse-system-has-limit}
Let $S$ be a scheme. Let $I$ be a directed partially ordered set.
Let $(X_i, f_{ii'})$ be an inverse system over $I$
in the category of algebraic spaces over $S$.
If the morphisms $f_{ii'} : X_i \to X_{i'}$ are affine, then the
limit $X = \lim_i X_i$ (as an fppf sheaf) is an algebraic space.
Moreover,
\begin{enumerate}
\item each of the morphisms $f_i : X \to X_i$ is affine,
\item for any $i \in I$ and any morphism of algebraic spaces
$T \to X_i$ we have
$$
X \times_{X_i} T = \lim_{i' \geq i} X_{i'} \times_{X_i} T.
$$
as algebraic spaces over $S$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Part (2) is a formal consequence of the existence of the
limit $X = \lim X_i$ as an algebraic space over $S$.
Choose an element $0 \in I$ (this is possible as a directed partially
ordered set is nonempty). Choose a scheme $U_0$ and a surjective
\'etale morphism $U_0 \to X_0$. Set $R_0 = U_0 \times_{X_0} U_0$
so that $X_0 = U_0/R_0$. For $i \geq 0$ set
$U_i = X_i \times_{X_0} U_0$ and
$R_i = X_i \times_{X_0} R_0 = U_i \times_{X_i} U_i$.
By Limits, Lemma \ref{limits-lemma-directed-inverse-system-has-limit}
we see that $U = \lim_{i \geq 0} U_i$ and $R = \lim_{i \geq 0} R_i$
are schemes. Moreover, the two morphisms $s, t : R \to U$ are the base
change of the two projections $R_0 \to U_0$ by the morphism
$U \to U_0$ and the morphism $R \to U \times_S U$ is the base change
of the morphism $R_0 \to U_0 \times_S U_0$ by the morphism
$U \times_S U \to U_0 \times_S U_0$. Hence the morphism
$R \to U \times_S U$ is an \'etale equivalence relation. We claim that
the natural map
\begin{equation}
\label{equation-isomorphism-sheaves}
U/R \longrightarrow \lim X_i
\end{equation}
is an isomorphism of fppf sheaves on the category of schemes over $S$.
The claim implies $X = \lim X_i$ is an algebraic
space by Spaces, Theorem \ref{spaces-theorem-presentation}.

\medskip\noindent
Let $Z$ be a scheme and let $a : Z \to \lim X_i$ be a morphism.
Then $a = (a_i)$ where $a_i : Z \to X_i$. Set $W_0 = Z \times_{a_0, X_0} U_0$.
Note that $W_0 = Z \times_{a_i, X_i} U_i$ for all $i \geq 0$ by our
choice of $U_i \to X_i$ above. Hence we obtain a morphism
$W_0 \to \lim_{i \geq 0} U_i = U$. Since $W_0 \to Z$ is surjective
and \'etale, we conclude that (\ref{equation-isomorphism-sheaves})
is a surjective map of sheaves. Finally, suppose that
$Z$ is a scheme and that $a, b : Z \to U/R$ are two morphisms
which are equalized by (\ref{equation-isomorphism-sheaves}).
We have to show that $a = b$.
After replacing $Z$ by the members of an fppf covering
we may assume there exist morphisms $a', b' : Z \to U$ which
give rise to $a$ and $b$. The condition that $a, b$ are
equalized by (\ref{equation-isomorphism-sheaves}) means that
for each $i \geq 0$ the compositions $a_i', b_i' : Z \to U \to U_i$
are equal as morphisms into $U_i/R_i = X_i$. Hence
$(a_i', b_i') : Z \to U_i \times_S U_i$ factors through
$R_i$, say by some morphism $c_i : Z \to R_i$. Since
$R = \lim_{i \geq 0} R_i$ we see that $c = \lim c_i : Z \to R$
is a morphism which shows that $a, b$ are equal as morphisms
of $Z$ into $U/R$.

\medskip\noindent
Part (1) follows as we have seen above that
$U_i \times_{X_i} X = U$ and $U \to U_i$ is affine by
construction.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-descend-section}
Let $S$ be a scheme. Let $I$ be a directed partially ordered set.
Let $(X_i, f_{ii'})$ be an inverse system over $I$ of algebraic spaces
over $S$. Assume
\begin{enumerate}
\item the morphisms $f_{ii'} : X_i \to X_{i'}$ are affine,
\item each $X_i$ is quasi-compact and quasi-separated.
\end{enumerate}
Let $X = \lim_i X_i$. Let $0 \in I$. Suppose that $\mathcal{F}_0$ is a
quasi-coherent sheaf on $X_0$. Set $\mathcal{F}_i = f_{0i}^*\mathcal{F}_0$
for $i \geq 0$ and set $\mathcal{F} = f_0^*\mathcal{F}_0$. Then
$$
\Gamma(X, \mathcal{F}) = \colim_{i \geq 0} \Gamma(X_i, \mathcal{F}_i)
$$
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Choose a surjective \'etale morphism $U_0 \to X_0$ where $U_0$ is an affine
scheme (Properties of Spaces, Lemma
\ref{spaces-properties-lemma-quasi-compact-affine-cover}).
Set $U_i = X_i \times_{X_0} U_0$.
Set $R_0 = U_0 \times_{X_0} U_0$ and $R_i = R_0 \times_{X_0} X_i$.
In the proof of Lemma \ref{lemma-directed-inverse-system-has-limit} we have
seen that there exists a presentation $X = U/R$ with
$U = \lim U_i$ and $R = \lim R_i$.
Note that $U_i$ and $U$ are affine and that $R_i$ and $R$ are
quasi-compact and separated (as $X_i$ is quasi-separated). Hence
Limits, Lemma \ref{lemma-descend-section}
implies that
$$
\mathcal{F}(U) = \colim \mathcal{F}_i(U_i)
\quad\text{and}\quad
\mathcal{F}(R) = \colim \mathcal{F}_i(R_i).
$$
The lemma follows as
$\Gamma(X, \mathcal{F}) = \text{Ker}(\mathcal{F}(U) \to \mathcal{F}(R))$
and similarly
$\Gamma(X_i, \mathcal{F}_i) =
\text{Ker}(\mathcal{F}_i(U_i) \to \mathcal{F}_i(R_i))$
\end{proof}
