\section{Introduction}
\label{section-introduction}

\noindent
In this chapter we put material related to limits of algebraic spaces.
A first topic is the characterization of algebraic spaces $F$ locally
of finite presentation over the base $S$ as limit preserving functors.
We continue with a study of limits of inverse systems over directed
partially ordered sets with affine transition maps. We discuss absolute
Noetherian approximation for quasi-compact and quasi-separated algebraic
spaces following \cite{CLO}. Another approach is due to David Rydh (see
\cite{rydh_approx}) whose results also cover absolute Noetherian
approximation for certain algebraic stacks.


\section{Conventions}
\label{section-conventions}

\noindent
The standing assumption is that all schemes are contained in
a big fppf site $\Sch_{fppf}$. And all rings $A$ considered
have the property that $\Spec(A)$ is (isomorphic) to an
object of this big site.

\medskip\noindent
Let $S$ be a scheme and let $X$ be an algebraic space over $S$.
In this chapter and the following we will write $X \times_S X$
for the product of $X$ with itself (in the category of algebraic
spaces over $S$), instead of $X \times X$.











\section{Morphisms of finite presentation}
\label{section-finite-presentation}

\noindent
In this section we generalize
Limits, Proposition
\ref{limits-proposition-characterize-locally-finite-presentation}
to morphisms of algebraic spaces.
The motivation for the following definition comes from
the proposition just cited.

\begin{definition}
\label{definition-locally-finite-presentation}
Let $S$ be a scheme.
\begin{enumerate}
\item A functor $F : (\Sch/S)_{fppf}^{opp} \to \textit{Sets}$
is said to be {\it locally of finite presentation} or {\it limit preserving} if
for every affine scheme $T$ over $S$ which is a limit $T = \lim T_i$
of a directed inverse system of affine schemes $T_i$ over $S$, we have
$$
F(T) = \colim F(T_i).
$$
We sometimes say that $F$ is {\it locally of finite presentation over $S$}.
\item Let $F, G : (\Sch/S)_{fppf}^{opp} \to \textit{Sets}$.
A transformation of functors $a : F \to G$
is {\it locally of finite presentation} if for every scheme $T$ over $S$
and every $y \in G(T)$ the functor
$$
F_y : (\Sch/T)_{fppf}^{opp} \longrightarrow \textit{Sets}, \quad
T'/T \longmapsto \{x \in F(T') \mid a(x) = y|_{T'}\}
$$
is locally of finite presentation over $T$\footnote{The characterization (2) in
Lemma \ref{lemma-characterize-relative-limit-preserving}
may be easier to parse.}. We sometimes say that
$F$ is {\it relatively limit preserving} over $G$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

\noindent
The functor $F_y$ is in some sense the fiber of
$a : F \to G$ over $y$, except that it is a presheaf on the big fppf
site of $T$. A formula for this functor is:
\begin{equation}
\label{equation-fibre-map-functors}
F_y =
F|_{(\Sch/T)_{fppf}}
{\times}_{G|_{(\Sch/T)_{fppf}}}
*
\end{equation}
Here $*$ is the final object in the category of (pre)sheaves
on $(\Sch/T)_{fppf}$ (see
Sites, Example \ref{sites-example-singleton-sheaf})
and the map $* \to G|_{(\Sch/T)_{fppf}}$ is given by $y$.
Note that if $j : (\Sch/T)_{fppf} \to (\Sch/S)_{fppf}$
is the localization functor, then the formula above becomes
$F_y = j^{-1}F \times_{j^{-1}G} *$ and $j_!F_y$ is just the fiber product
$F \times_{G, y} T$. (See
Sites, Section \ref{sites-section-localize},
for information on localization, and especially
Sites, Remark \ref{sites-remark-localize-presheaves}
for information on $j_!$ for presheaves.)

\medskip\noindent
At this point we temporarily have two definitions of what it means
for a morphism $X \to Y$ of algebraic spaces over $S$ to be locally of finite
presentation. Namely, one by
Morphisms of Spaces,
Definition \ref{spaces-morphisms-definition-locally-finite-presentation}
and one using that $X \to Y$ is a transformation of functors so that
Definition \ref{definition-locally-finite-presentation}
applies. We will show in
Proposition \ref{proposition-characterize-locally-finite-presentation}
that these two definitions agree.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-characterize-relative-limit-preserving}
Let $S$ be a scheme. Let $a : F \to G$ be a transformation of functors
$(\Sch/S)_{fppf}^{opp} \to \textit{Sets}$.
The following are equivalent
\begin{enumerate}
\item $F$ is relatively limit preserving over $G$, and
\item for every every affine scheme $T$ over $S$ which is a
limit $T = \lim T_i$ of a directed inverse system of affine
schemes $T_i$ over $S$ the diagram of sets
$$
\xymatrix{
\colim_i F(T_i) \ar[r] \ar[d]_a & F(T) \ar[d]^a \\
\colim_i G(T_i) \ar[r] & G(T)
}
$$
is a fibre product diagram.
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Assume (1). Consider $T = \lim_{i \in I} T_i$ as in (2). Let
$(y, x_T)$ be an element of the fibre product
$\colim_i G(T_i) \times_{G(T)} F(T)$.
Then $y$ comes from $y_i \in G(T_i)$ for some $i$.
Consider the functor $F_{y_i}$ on $(\Sch/T_i)_{fppf}$ as in
Definition \ref{definition-locally-finite-presentation}.
We see that $x_T \in F_{y_i}(T)$. Moreover $T = \lim_{i' \geq i} T_{i'}$
is a directed system of affine schemes over $T_i$. Hence (1) implies
that $x_T$ the image of a unique element $x$ of
$\colim_{i' \geq i} F_{y_i}(T_{i'})$. Thus $x$ is the unique
element of $\colim F(T_i)$ which maps to the pair $(y, x_T)$.
This proves that (2) holds.

\medskip\noindent
Assume (2). Let $T$ be a scheme and $y_T \in G(T)$. We have to show that
$F_{y_T}$ is limit preserving. Let $T' = \lim_{i \in I} T'_i$ be an
affine scheme over $T$ which is the directed limit of affine scheme $T'_i$
over $T$. Let $x_{T'} \in F_{y_T}$. Pick $i \in I$ which is possible as
$I$ is a directed partially ordered set. Denote $y_i \in F(T'_i)$ the
image of $y_{T'}$. Then we see that $(y_i, x_{T'})$ is an
element of the fibre product
$\colim_i G(T'_i) \times_{G(T')} F(T')$.
Hence by (2) we get a unique element $x$ of $\colim_i F(T'_i)$
mapping to $(y_i, x_{T'})$. It is clear that $x$ defines an element
of $\colim_i F_y(T'_i)$ mapping to $x_{T'}$ and we win.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-composition-locally-finite-presentation}
Let $S$ be a scheme contained in $\Sch_{fppf}$.
Let $F, G, H : (\Sch/S)_{fppf}^{opp} \to \textit{Sets}$.
Let $a : F \to G$, $b : G \to H$ be transformations of functors.
If $a$ and $b$ are locally of finite presentation, then
$$
b \circ a : F \longrightarrow H
$$
is locally of finite presentation.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Let $T = \lim_{i \in I} T_i$ as in characterization (2) of
Lemma \ref{lemma-characterize-relative-limit-preserving}.
Consider the diagram
$$
\xymatrix{
\colim_i F(T_i) \ar[r] \ar[d]_a & F(T) \ar[d]^a \\
\colim_i G(T_i) \ar[r] \ar[d]_b & G(T) \ar[d]^b \\
\colim_i H(T_i) \ar[r] & H(T)
}
$$
By assumption the two squares are fibre product squares. Hence the
outer rectangle is a fibre product diagram too which proves the lemma.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-base-change-locally-finite-presentation}
Let $S$ be a scheme contained in $\Sch_{fppf}$.
Let $F, G, H : (\Sch/S)_{fppf}^{opp} \to \textit{Sets}$.
Let $a : F \to G$, $b : H \to G$ be transformations of functors.
Consider the fibre product diagram
$$
\xymatrix{
H \times_{b, G, a} F \ar[r]_-{b'} \ar[d]_{a'} & F \ar[d]^a \\
H \ar[r]^b & G
}
$$
If $a$ is locally of finite presentation, then the base change $a'$ is
locally of finite presentation.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Omitted. Hint: This is formal.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-limit-fppf-topology}
Let $T$ be an affine scheme which is written as a limit
$T = \lim_{i \in I} T_i$ of a directed inverse system of affine schemes.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Let $\mathcal{V} = \{V_j \to T\}_{j = 1, \ldots, m}$ be a standard fppf
covering of $T$, see
Topologies, Definition \ref{topologies-definition-standard-fppf}.
Then there exists an index $i$ and a standard fppf covering
$\mathcal{V}_i = \{V_{i, j} \to T_i\}_{j = 1, \ldots, m}$
whose base change $T \times_{T_i} \mathcal{V}_i$ to $T$
is isomorphic to $\mathcal{V}$.
\item Let $\mathcal{V}_i$, $\mathcal{V}'_i$ be a pair of standard
fppf coverings of $T_i$. If
$f : T \times_{T_i} \mathcal{V} \to T \times_{T_i} \mathcal{V}'_i$ is
a morphism of coverings of $T$, then there exists an index
$i' \geq i$ and a morphism
$f_{i'} : T_{i'} \times_{T_i} \mathcal{V} \to
T_{i'} \times_{T_i} \mathcal{V}'_i$
whose base change to $T$ is $f$.
\item If
$f, g : \mathcal{V} \to \mathcal{V}'_i$
are morphisms of standard fppf coverings of $T_i$ whose
base changes $f_T, g_T$ to $T$ are equal then there exists an
index $i' \geq i$ such that $f_{T_{i'}} = g_{T_{i'}}$.
\end{enumerate}
In other words, the category of standard fppf coverings of $T$ is
the colimit over $I$ of the categories of standard fppf coverings of $T_i$
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
By
Limits, Lemma \ref{limits-lemma-descend-finite-presentation}
the category of schemes of finite presentation over $T$ is the
colimit over $I$ of the categories of finite presentation over $T_i$. By
Limits, Lemmas \ref{limits-lemma-descend-affine-finite-presentation}
and \ref{limits-lemma-descend-flat-finite-presentation}
the same is true for category of schemes which are affine, flat and
of finite presentation over $T$.
To finish the proof of the lemma it suffices to show that if
$\{V_{j, i} \to T_i\}_{j = 1, \ldots, m}$ is a finite family of
flat finitely presented morphisms with $V_{j, i}$ affine, and the
base change $\coprod_j T \times_{T_i} V_{j, i} \to T$ is surjective,
then for some $i' \geq i$ the morphism
$\coprod T_{i'} \times_{T_i} V_{j, i} \to T_{i'}$ is surjective.
Denote $W_{i'} \subset T_{i'}$, resp.\ $W \subset T$ the image.
Of course $W = T$ by assumption.
Since the morphisms are flat and of finite presentation we see that
$W_i$ is a quasi-compact open of $T_i$, see
Morphisms, Lemma \ref{morphisms-lemma-fppf-open}.
Moreover, $W = T \times_{T_i} W_i$ (formation of image commutes
with base change). Hence by
Limits, Lemma \ref{limits-lemma-descend-opens}
we conclude that $W_{i'} = T_{i'}$ for some large enough $i'$
and we win.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-sheafify-finite-presentation}
Let $S$ be a scheme contained in $\Sch_{fppf}$.
Let $F : (\Sch/S)_{fppf}^{opp} \to \textit{Sets}$ be a functor.
If $F$ is locally of finite presentation over $S$ then its sheafification
$F^\#$ is locally of finite presentation over $S$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Assume $F$ is locally of finite presentation.
It suffices to show that $F^+$ is locally of finite presentation, since
$F^\# = (F^+)^+$, see
Sites, Theorem \ref{sites-theorem-plus}.
Let $T$ be an affine scheme over $S$, and let $T = \lim T_i$ be written
as the directed limit of an inverse system of affine $S$ schemes.
Recall that $F^+(T)$ is the colimit of $\check H^0(\mathcal{V}, F)$
where the limit is over all coverings of $T$ in $(\Sch/S)_{fppf}$.
Any fppf covering of an affine scheme can be refined by a standard
fppf covering, see
Topologies, Lemma \ref{topologies-lemma-fppf-affine}.
Hence we can write
$$
F^+(T)
=
\colim_{\mathcal{V}\text{ standard covering }T}
\check H^0(\mathcal{V}, F).
$$
By
Lemma \ref{lemma-limit-fppf-topology}
we may rewrite this as
$$
\colim_{i \in I}
\colim_{\mathcal{V}_i\text{ standard covering }T_i}
\check H^0(T \times_{T_i}\mathcal{V}_i, F).
$$
(The order of the colimits is irrelevant by
Categories, Lemma \ref{categories-lemma-colimits-commute}.)
Given a standard fppf covering
$\mathcal{V}_i = \{V_j \to T_i\}_{j = 1, \ldots, m}$ of $T_i$ we see that
$$
T \times_{T_i} V_j = \lim_{i' \geq i} T_{i'} \times_T V_j
$$
by
Limits, Lemma \ref{limits-lemma-scheme-over-limit}, and similarly
$$
T \times_{T_i} (V_j \times_{T_i} V_{j'}) =
\lim_{i' \geq i} T_{i'} \times_T (V_j \times_{T_i} V_{j'}).
$$
As the presheaf $F$ is locally of finite presentation this means that
$$
\check H^0(T \times_{T_i}\mathcal{V}_i, F)
=
\colim_{i' \geq i}
\check H^0(T_{i'} \times_{T_i}\mathcal{V}_i, F).
$$
Hence the colimit expression for $F^+(T)$ above collapses to
$$
\colim_{i \in I} \colim_{\mathcal{V}\text{ standard covering }T_i}
\check H^0(\mathcal{V}, F).
=
\colim_{i \in I} F^+(T_i).
$$
In other words $F^+(T) = \colim_i F^+(T_i)$ and hence
the lemma holds.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-sheaf-finite-presentation}
Let $S$ be a scheme.
Let $F : (\Sch/S)_{fppf}^{opp} \to \textit{Sets}$ be a functor.
Assume that
\begin{enumerate}
\item $F$ is a sheaf, and
\item there exists an fppf covering $\{U_j \to S\}_{j \in J}$ such that
$F|_{(\Sch/U_j)_{fppf}}$ is locally of finite presentation.
\end{enumerate}
Then $F$ is locally of finite presentation.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Let $T$ be an affine scheme over $S$.
Let $I$ be a directed partially ordered set, and let
$T_i$ be an inverse system of affine schemes over $S$ such that
$T = \lim T_i$. We have to show that the canonical
map $\colim F(T_i) \to F(T)$ is bijective.

\medskip\noindent
Choose some $0 \in I$ and choose a standard fppf covering
$\{V_{0, k} \to T_{0}\}_{k = 1, \ldots, m}$ which refines
the pullback $\{U_j \times_S T_0 \to T_0\}$ of the given fppf covering of $S$.
For each $i \geq 0$ we set $V_{i, k} = T_i \times_{T_0} V_{0, k}$, and
we set $V_k = T \times_{T_0} V_{0, k}$. Note that
$V_k = \lim_{i \geq 0} V_{i, k}$, see
Limits, Lemma \ref{limits-lemma-scheme-over-limit}.

\medskip\noindent
Suppose that $x, x' \in \colim F(T_i)$ map to the same
element of $F(T)$. Say $x, x'$ are given by elements $x_i, x'_i \in F(T_i)$
for some $i \in I$ (we may choose the same $i$ for both as $I$ is directed).
By assumption (2) and the fact that $x_i, x'_i$ map to the same element
of $F(T)$ this implies that
$$
x_i|_{V_{i', k}} = x'_i|_{V_{i', k}}
$$
for some suitably large $i' \in I$. We can choose the same $i'$ for each
$k$ as $k \in \{1, \ldots, m\}$ ranges over a finite set.
Since $\{V_{i', k} \to T_{i'}\}$
is an fppf covering and $F$ is a sheaf this implies that
$x_i|_{T_{i'}} = x'_i|_{T_{i'}}$ as desired. This proves that the map
$\colim F(T_i) \to F(T)$ is injective.

\medskip\noindent
To show surjectivity we argue in a similar fashion.
Let $x \in F(T)$. By assumption (2) for each $k$ we
can choose a $i$ such that $x|_{V_k}$ comes from an
element $x_{i, k} \in F(V_{i, k})$. As before we may choose a
single $i$ which works for all $k$. By the injectivity
proved above we see that
$$
x_{i, k}|_{V_{i', k} \times_{T_{i'}} V_{i', l}}
=
x_{i, l}|_{V_{i', k} \times_{T_{i'}} V_{i', l}}
$$
for some large enough $i'$. Hence by the sheaf condition of $F$
the elements $x_{i, k}|_{V_{i', k}}$ glue to an element $x_{i'} \in F(T_{i'})$
as desired.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-sheafify-finite-presentation-map}
Let $S$ be a scheme contained in $\Sch_{fppf}$.
Let $F, G : (\Sch/S)_{fppf}^{opp} \to \textit{Sets}$ be functors.
If $a : F \to G$ is a transformation which is locally of finite
presentation, then the induced transformation of sheaves
$F^\# \to G^\#$ is of finite presentation.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Suppose that $T$ is a scheme and $y \in G^\#(T)$.
We have to show the functor
$F^\#_y : (\Sch/T)_{fppf}^{opp} \to \textit{Sets}$
constructed from $F^\# \to G^\#$ and $y$ as in
Definition \ref{definition-locally-finite-presentation}
is locally of finite presentation.
By Equation (\ref{equation-fibre-map-functors})
we see that $F^\#_y$ is a sheaf. Choose an fppf covering
$\{V_j \to T\}_{j \in J}$ such that $y|_{V_j}$ comes from
an element $y_j \in F(V_j)$.
Note that the restriction of $F^\#$ to $(\Sch/V_j)_{fppf}$
is just $F^\#_{y_j}$. If we can show that $F^\#_{y_j}$ is
locally of finite presentation then
Lemma \ref{lemma-sheaf-finite-presentation}
garantees that $F^\#_y$ is locally of finite presentation and
we win. This reduces us to the case $y \in G(T)$.

\medskip\noindent
Let $y \in G(T)$. In this case we claim that $F^\#_y = (F_y)^\#$.
This follows from
Equation (\ref{equation-fibre-map-functors}).
Thus this case follows from
Lemma \ref{lemma-sheafify-finite-presentation}.
\end{proof}

\begin{proposition}
\label{proposition-characterize-locally-finite-presentation}
Let $S$ be a scheme. Let $f : X \to Y$ be a morphism of algebraic
spaces over $S$. The following are equivalent:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The morphism $f$ is a morphism of algebraic spaces which is
locally of finite presentation, see
Morphisms of Spaces,
Definition \ref{spaces-morphisms-definition-locally-finite-presentation}.
\item The morphism $f : X \to Y$ is locally of finite presentation as
a transformation of functors, see
Definition \ref{definition-locally-finite-presentation}.
\end{enumerate}
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
Assume (1). Let $T$ be a scheme and let $y \in Y(T)$. We have to show that
$T \times_X Y$ is locally of finite presentation over $T$ in the sense of
Definition \ref{definition-locally-finite-presentation}.
Hence we are reduced to proving that if $X$ is an algebraic space which
is locally of finite presentation over $S$ as an algebraic space, then it
is locally of finite presentation as a functor
$X : (\Sch/S)_{fppf}^{opp} \to \textit{Sets}$.
To see this choose a presentation $X = U/R$, see
Spaces, Definition \ref{spaces-definition-presentation}.
It follows from
Morphisms of Spaces,
Definition \ref{spaces-morphisms-definition-locally-finite-presentation}
that both $U$ and $R$ are schemes which are locally of finite presentation
over $S$. Hence by
Limits, Proposition
\ref{limits-proposition-characterize-locally-finite-presentation}
we have
$$
U(T) = \colim U(T_i), \quad
R(T) = \colim R(T_i)
$$
whenever $T = \lim_i T_i$ in $(\Sch/S)_{fppf}$. It follows
that the presheaf
$$
(\Sch/S)_{fppf}^{opp} \longrightarrow \textit{Sets}, \quad
W \longmapsto U(W)/R(W)
$$
is locally of finite presentation. Hence by
Lemma \ref{lemma-sheafify-finite-presentation}
its sheafification $X = U/R$ is locally of finite presentation too.

\medskip\noindent
Assume (2). Choose a scheme $V$ and a surjective \'etale morphism
$V \to Y$. Next, choose a scheme $U$ and a surjective \'etale morphism
$U \to V \times_Y X$. By
Lemma \ref{lemma-base-change-locally-finite-presentation}
the transformation of functors $V \times_Y X \to V$ is locally of
finite presentation. By
Morphisms of Spaces,
Lemma \ref{spaces-morphisms-lemma-etale-locally-finite-presentation}
the morphism of algebraic spaces $U \to V \times_Y X$ is locally
of finite presentation, hence locally of finite presentation as
a transformation of functors by the first part of the proof. By
Lemma \ref{lemma-composition-locally-finite-presentation}
the composition $U \to V \times_Y X \to V$ is locally of
finite presentation as a transformation of functors. Hence
the morphism of schemes $U \to V$ is locally of finite presentation by
Limits, Proposition
\ref{limits-proposition-characterize-locally-finite-presentation}
(modulo a set theoretic remark, see last paragraph of the proof).
This means, by definition, that (1) holds.

\medskip\noindent
Set theoretic remark. Let $U \to V$ be a morphism of
$(\Sch/S)_{fppf}$. In the statement of
Limits, Proposition
\ref{limits-proposition-characterize-locally-finite-presentation}
we characterize $U \to V$ as being locally of finite presentation
if for {\it all} directed inverse systems $(T_i, f_{ii'})$ of affine schemes
over $V$ we have $U(T) = \colim V(T_i)$, but in the current setting
we may only consider affine schemes $T_i$ over $V$ which are (isomorphic to)
an object of $(\Sch/S)_{fppf}$. So we have to make sure that there
are enough affines in $(\Sch/S)_{fppf}$ to make the proof work.
Inspecting the proof of (2) $\Rightarrow$ (1) of
Limits, Proposition
\ref{limits-proposition-characterize-locally-finite-presentation}
we see that the question reduces to the case that $U$ and $V$ are affine.
Say $U = \Spec(A)$ and $V = \Spec(B)$. By construction
of $(\Sch/S)_{fppf}$ the spectrum of any ring of cardinality
$\leq |B|$ is isomorphic to an object of $(\Sch/S)_{fppf}$.
Hence it suffices to observe that in the "only if" part of the proof of
Algebra, Lemma \ref{algebra-lemma-characterize-finite-presentation}
only $A$-algebras of cardinality $\leq |B|$ are used.
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}
\label{remark-limit-preserving}
Here is an important special case of
Proposition \ref{proposition-characterize-locally-finite-presentation}.
Let $S$ be a scheme. Let $X$ be an algebraic space over $S$.
Then $X$ is locally of finite presentation over $S$ if and only
if $X$, as a functor $(\Sch/S)^{opp} \to \textit{Sets}$,
is limit preserving. Compare with
Limits, Remark \ref{limits-remark-limit-preserving}.
\end{remark}















\section{Directed limits of algebraic spaces with affine transition maps}
\label{section-limits}

\noindent
The following lemma explains how we think of limits of algebraic
spaces in this chapter. We will use (without further mention) that the
base change of an affine morphism of algebraic spaces is affine (see
Morphisms of Spaces, Lemma \ref{spaces-morphisms-lemma-base-change-affine}).

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-directed-inverse-system-has-limit}
Let $S$ be a scheme. Let $I$ be a directed partially ordered set.
Let $(X_i, f_{ii'})$ be an inverse system over $I$
in the category of algebraic spaces over $S$.
If the morphisms $f_{ii'} : X_i \to X_{i'}$ are affine, then the
limit $X = \lim_i X_i$ (as an fppf sheaf) is an algebraic space.
Moreover,
\begin{enumerate}
\item each of the morphisms $f_i : X \to X_i$ is affine,
\item for any $i \in I$ and any morphism of algebraic spaces
$T \to X_i$ we have
$$
X \times_{X_i} T = \lim_{i' \geq i} X_{i'} \times_{X_i} T.
$$
as algebraic spaces over $S$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Part (2) is a formal consequence of the existence of the
limit $X = \lim X_i$ as an algebraic space over $S$.
Choose an element $0 \in I$ (this is possible as a directed partially
ordered set is nonempty). Choose a scheme $U_0$ and a surjective
\'etale morphism $U_0 \to X_0$. Set $R_0 = U_0 \times_{X_0} U_0$
so that $X_0 = U_0/R_0$. For $i \geq 0$ set
$U_i = X_i \times_{X_0} U_0$ and
$R_i = X_i \times_{X_0} R_0 = U_i \times_{X_i} U_i$.
By Limits, Lemma \ref{limits-lemma-directed-inverse-system-has-limit}
we see that $U = \lim_{i \geq 0} U_i$ and $R = \lim_{i \geq 0} R_i$
are schemes. Moreover, the two morphisms $s, t : R \to U$ are the base
change of the two projections $R_0 \to U_0$ by the morphism
$U \to U_0$ and the morphism $R \to U \times_S U$ is the base change
of the morphism $R_0 \to U_0 \times_S U_0$ by the morphism
$U \times_S U \to U_0 \times_S U_0$. Hence the morphism
$R \to U \times_S U$ is an \'etale equivalence relation. We claim that
the natural map
\begin{equation}
\label{equation-isomorphism-sheaves}
U/R \longrightarrow \lim X_i
\end{equation}
is an isomorphism of fppf sheaves on the category of schemes over $S$.
The claim implies $X = \lim X_i$ is an algebraic
space by Spaces, Theorem \ref{spaces-theorem-presentation}.

\medskip\noindent
Let $Z$ be a scheme and let $a : Z \to \lim X_i$ be a morphism.
Then $a = (a_i)$ where $a_i : Z \to X_i$. Set $W_0 = Z \times_{a_0, X_0} U_0$.
Note that $W_0 = Z \times_{a_i, X_i} U_i$ for all $i \geq 0$ by our
choice of $U_i \to X_i$ above. Hence we obtain a morphism
$W_0 \to \lim_{i \geq 0} U_i = U$. Since $W_0 \to Z$ is surjective
and \'etale, we conclude that (\ref{equation-isomorphism-sheaves})
is a surjective map of sheaves. Finally, suppose that
$Z$ is a scheme and that $a, b : Z \to U/R$ are two morphisms
which are equalized by (\ref{equation-isomorphism-sheaves}).
We have to show that $a = b$.
After replacing $Z$ by the members of an fppf covering
we may assume there exist morphisms $a', b' : Z \to U$ which
give rise to $a$ and $b$. The condition that $a, b$ are
equalized by (\ref{equation-isomorphism-sheaves}) means that
for each $i \geq 0$ the compositions $a_i', b_i' : Z \to U \to U_i$
are equal as morphisms into $U_i/R_i = X_i$. Hence
$(a_i', b_i') : Z \to U_i \times_S U_i$ factors through
$R_i$, say by some morphism $c_i : Z \to R_i$. Since
$R = \lim_{i \geq 0} R_i$ we see that $c = \lim c_i : Z \to R$
is a morphism which shows that $a, b$ are equal as morphisms
of $Z$ into $U/R$.

\medskip\noindent
Part (1) follows as we have seen above that
$U_i \times_{X_i} X = U$ and $U \to U_i$ is affine by
construction.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-space-over-limit}
Let $S$ be a scheme. Let $I$ be a directed partially ordered set.
Let $(X_i, f_{ii'})$ be an inverse system over $I$ of algebraic spaces
over $S$ with affine transition maps.
Let $X = \lim_i X_i$. Let $0 \in I$. Suppose that $T \to X_0$ is a
morphism of algebraic spaces. Then
$$
T \times_{X_0} X = \lim_{i \geq 0} T \times_{X_0} X_i
$$
as algebraic spaces over $S$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
The limit $X$ is an algebraic space by
Lemma \ref{lemma-directed-inverse-system-has-limit}.
The equality is formal, see
Categories, Lemma \ref{categories-lemma-colimits-commute}.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-descend-section}
Let $S$ be a scheme. Let $I$ be a directed partially ordered set.
Let $(X_i, f_{ii'})$ be an inverse system over $I$ of algebraic spaces
over $S$. Assume
\begin{enumerate}
\item the morphisms $f_{ii'} : X_i \to X_{i'}$ are affine,
\item each $X_i$ is quasi-compact and quasi-separated.
\end{enumerate}
Let $X = \lim_i X_i$. Let $0 \in I$. Suppose that $\mathcal{F}_0$ is a
quasi-coherent sheaf on $X_0$. Set $\mathcal{F}_i = f_{0i}^*\mathcal{F}_0$
for $i \geq 0$ and set $\mathcal{F} = f_0^*\mathcal{F}_0$. Then
$$
\Gamma(X, \mathcal{F}) = \colim_{i \geq 0} \Gamma(X_i, \mathcal{F}_i)
$$
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Choose a surjective \'etale morphism $U_0 \to X_0$ where $U_0$ is an affine
scheme (Properties of Spaces, Lemma
\ref{spaces-properties-lemma-quasi-compact-affine-cover}).
Set $U_i = X_i \times_{X_0} U_0$.
Set $R_0 = U_0 \times_{X_0} U_0$ and $R_i = R_0 \times_{X_0} X_i$.
In the proof of Lemma \ref{lemma-directed-inverse-system-has-limit} we have
seen that there exists a presentation $X = U/R$ with
$U = \lim U_i$ and $R = \lim R_i$.
Note that $U_i$ and $U$ are affine and that $R_i$ and $R$ are
quasi-compact and separated (as $X_i$ is quasi-separated). Hence
Limits, Lemma \ref{limits-lemma-descend-section}
implies that
$$
\mathcal{F}(U) = \colim \mathcal{F}_i(U_i)
\quad\text{and}\quad
\mathcal{F}(R) = \colim \mathcal{F}_i(R_i).
$$
The lemma follows as
$\Gamma(X, \mathcal{F}) = \text{Ker}(\mathcal{F}(U) \to \mathcal{F}(R))$
and similarly
$\Gamma(X_i, \mathcal{F}_i) =
\text{Ker}(\mathcal{F}_i(U_i) \to \mathcal{F}_i(R_i))$
\end{proof}
