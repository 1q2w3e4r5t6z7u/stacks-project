\noindent
The philosophy behind the conventions used in writing these documents is
to choose those conventions that work.

\section{Set theory}
\label{section-sets}

\noindent
We use Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory with the axiom of choice.
See \cite{Kunen}.

\section{Categories}
\label{section-categories}

\noindent
A category $C$ consists of a set of objects, and for each pair of objects
a set of morphisms between them. In other words, it is what is called
a ``small'' category in other texts. We will use ``big'' categories
(categories whose objects form a proper class)
as well, but only those that are listed in Categories,
Remark \ref{categories-remark-big-categories}.

\section{Algebra}
\label{section-algebra}

\noindent
In these notes a ring is a commutative ring with a $1$. Hence the
category of rings has an initial object $\mathbf{Z}$ and a final
object $\{0\}$ (this is the unique ring where $1 = 0$). Modules are
assumed unitary. See \cite{Eisenbud}.
