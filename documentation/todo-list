Add more material on algebraic stacks.


Algebraic Spaces: It might be useful to list all the properties $P$ such
that: $f$ has $P \Rightarrow \Delta_f$ has $P$. Then if $f$ is stable under
base change, then $g \circ f$ and $g$ have $P \Rightarrow f$ has $P$.
Notable exceptions are quasi-compact and finite
type and this explains the relevance of qcqs and finite presentation.


For non-representable morphisms (of Artin stacks), one can define
"unramified $=$ $R$-unramified" as "locally of finite type and diagonal
etale" or as "locally of finite type and formally unramified" and "etale"
as "locally of finite presentation, flat, and unramified". This looks like
a circular definition but in each step we take the diagonal.


For stacks there is also a notion of "formally Deligne-Mumford". One gets
the very pleasing list:

  *  DM $=$ formally DM
  *  R-unramified $=$ formally unramified + loc. of finite type
  *  etale $=$ formally etale + loc. of finite presentation

Here, the increasing finiteness hypothesis can be explained by the fact
the diagonal of anything is locally of finite type and the diagonal of locally of finite type is locally of finite presentation. Also

  *  DM $\Leftrightarrow$ diagonal unramified
  *  unramified $\Rightarrow$ diagonal etale.


Limits of Schemes: Absloute Noetherian approximation. Add a second proof
following Temkin's proof in [Relative RZ-spaces, section 1.1]. Look also
at David Rydh's paper [Noetherian approximation of algebraic spaces and
stacks]. In fact, using this method one gets a short proof of a more
general approximation result: $X$, $S$ qc and qs schemes, then $X \to S$
can be approximated as affine and finite presentation and if $X \to S$ is
of finite type then we can do closed immersion and finite presentation.
The main point here will be to excise push-outs from the proof.


Introduce the notion: "pseudo-noetherian" (suggested by Brian Conrad) as
a scheme/stack $X$ which is quasi-compact, quasi-separated and has the
property that any quasi-coherent sheaf is the direct limit of finitely
presented sheaves. David Rydh suggests: require that this holds on $X'$
for any finitely presented $X' \to X$ as this turns out to be quite useful.
Examples of pseudo-noetherian stacks are noetherian stacks, qcqs algebraic
spaces and qcqs stacks with quasi-finite diagonal.


The approximation results generalizes some of the foundational results,
e.g. in Chevalley's theorem on affineness we can let the finite morphism be
integral (and also let the target be an algebraic space). This is done for
schemes but not yet done for algebraic spaces.


Add the equivalence (for morphisms of algebraic spaces):

  *  radicial + loc. separated $\Leftrightarrow$ diagonal nil-immersion

Not known whether there exist radicial non-quasi-separated morphisms
(necessarily not locally separated).


Also, for a stack (with algebraic points) one would have to interpret
``radicial'' as "there is exactly one point in every fiber and the residue
field extension is inseparable". The definition of universally injective as
$X(K) \to S(K)$ injective is not good for stacks (perhaps ok if we restrict
to $K$ algebraically closed) unless we pass to the associated sheaf. Again
we have:

  *  universally injective $\Leftrightarrow$ diagonal surjective


A related note is that points of any quasi-separated stack (i.e., stack
with quasi-compact and quasi-separated diagonal) are algebraic. This is
due to David Rydh.


Write a chapter on push-outs in the stacks project. This may have been
one of the essential parts of the first conception of EGA V (later moved to
Chapter VI). The algebra/scheme part is worked out in detail by Ferrand
"Conducteur, Descente et Pincement" and it generalizes to algebraic spaces
(the correct level of generality).


In the chapter on Chow homology and Chern classes, maximize the use of
Lemma lemma-secondary-ramification (Tag 02QJ). In particular, prove a
version of Lemma lemma-commutativity-effective-Cartier (Tag 02TF) with
supports. This will lead to a proof of commutativity of intersecting with
effective Cartier divisors, which does not use blowing up Section
section-blowing-up-lemmas (Tag 02SY) at all.


Rewrite parts of the chapter on Chow homology and Chern classes in order
to have intersections with supports where relevant. There should be
``explicit'' supports and not just of the order of saying that the product
$D \cdot \alpha$ is supported in $Supp(D) \cap Supp(\alpha)$.


Chapter on Etale cohomology: Integrate with the rest of the project. This
means finding references to unproven results, removing any mention of the
fpqc site (although fpqc coverings can be used), etc. Either remove the
last few sections or find a way of clearly indicating that they are
`further topics''.


Write sections on Brauer groups: for each case of algebra, schemes,
spaces, stacks.


Start a chapter on noncommutative algebra.


Artin's theorem on representability.


Keel and Mori (some of it is already there). Etc, etc. See also the
chapter Desirables.


Put the following (suggested by David Rydh) in the stacks project:
Using ZMT, one proves the fact that if $f : X \to Y$ is quasi-finite and
separated then the subset $U$ of $y$'s such that $f$ restricted to
$Spec(\mathcal{O}_{Y, y})$ is finite is open. This is almost a one-liner:
The question is local so we can assume that $Y$ is affine. Take a ZMT
factorization $X \to W \to Y$. Then $U = Y \ (image of W \ X)$.
Indeed, the closure of a subset commutes with flat base change. In the same
spirit, one easily shows (without ZMT) that if $f : X \to Y$ is
quasi-affine then the subset of $y$'s such that $f$ restricted to
$Spec(\mathcal{O}_{Y,y})$ is affine is open.


Prove an algebraic space is a scheme if and only if its reduction is a
scheme.


Add material on connected component of identity of group schemes.


(Not completely sure this is correct. Haven't worked out all the details.)
Show that if $G$ is a flat group scheme over an Artinian local ring $A$,
and $G$ acts on the scheme $X$ over $A$ such that

  1. the special fibre $X_0$ is a torsor under $G_0$, and
  2. $A \subset \Gamma(X, O_X)$

then $X$ is a $G$-torsor over $S$. Generalize to $A$ just local with
(locally?) nilpotent maximal ideal.


Show that if $(U, R, s, t, c)$ is a groupoid scheme with $U = Spec(k)$
and $s$, $t$ finite type, then $(U, R, s, t, c)$ is defined over a field
$k_0$ which is a subfield of $k$ of finite index.


Introduce the notion of a complete intersection ring, and prove some of
its basic properties, for example that if $A \to B$ is a flat local
homomorphism of Noetherian local rings, then $B$ is C.I. if and only if
$A$ and $B/m_AB$ are C.I.


In the section "Ample invertible sheaves and cohomology" of the chapter
on cohomology of coherent sheaves actually apply the results to ample
invertible sheaves.


Redo the sections on syntomic ring maps using the material on Koszul
sequences in rings.


Improve the chapter "Simplicial Methods" in the following way:

  1. Distinguish more clearly between general material, material on
    (co)simplicial sets, and material on (co)simplicial objects in abelian
    categories. Maybe rearrange things so general material comes first?
  2. Introduce the functor from semi-simplicial objects in an
    abelian category to simplicial objects in the same.
  3. Prove the Dold-Kan correspondence directly using 2.
  4. Introduce Eilenberg-Maclane objects, etc and explain the
    significance of these in view of Dold-Kan.
  5. Say something about derived functors of non-additive functors?
