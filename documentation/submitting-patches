How to get your changes into the project
----------------------------------------


Certainly you can simply edit any of the TeX files and email the new version to
the mailing list algebraic_geometry@math.columbia.edu (subscribe first please).


On the other hand it is sometimes convenient to send only the difference
between the new version and the old one. Please use "diff -u" in this case to
produce the patch. It will help if you follow the suggestions below, or do
something with equivalent endproduct.


To create a patch for a single file, say stacks.tex, you can do the following.
First download stacks.tex. Make a copy:

	cp stacks.tex stacks.tex.orig

and then edit stacks.tex as you like. (Or, if you've already edited the file,
you download and save the version from the web directly as stacks.tex.orig.) To
make the patch use

	diff -u stacks.tex.orig stacks.tex > patchfile

Submit the patchfile to the mailing list; please include PATCH in the subject.


To create a patch for the whole project directory, you can do the following.
Download the file stacks-0.2.tar.bz2 to ~ say. To set up a working directory
and a local copy of the original:

	cd ~
	mkdir stacks-0.2
	tar --directory stacks-0.2 -xjf stacks-0.2.tar.bz2
	cp -a stacks-0.2 stacks-0.2.orig

At this point you edit the files in stacks-0.2/src, run make, etc. When you are
done, produce a patch as follows:

	cd ~
	diff -ruNb -X stacks-0.2.orig/src/documentation/dontdiff \
		stacks-0.2.orig stacks-0.2 > patchfile

Submit the patchfile to the mailing list; please include PATCH in the subject.
