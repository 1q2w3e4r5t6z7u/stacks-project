How to make the project
-----------------------

These instructions require GNU Make or another Make clone -- your system likely
has one. To create the dvi files type

	make

on the command line inside the directory containing the Makefile. To create the
pdf files type

	make pdfs

on the command line inside the directory containing the Makefile. To create the
book type

	make book

After doing this you can copy the dvi/pdf files to a directory of choice.

Email if you run into any problems.
