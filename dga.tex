In this chapter we talk about differential graded algebras, modules,
categories, etc. A basic reference is \cite{Keller-Deriving}.

\section{Differential graded algebras}
\label{section-dga}

\begin{definition}
\label{definition-dga}
Let $R$ be a (commutative) ring.
A {\it differential graded algebra} is either
\begin{enumerate}
\item a chain complex $A_\bullet$ of $R$-modules endowed with
$R$-bilinear maps $A_n \times A_m \to A_{n + m}$,
$(a, b) \mapsto ab$ such that
$$
d_{n + m}(ab) = d_n(a)b + (-1)^n ad_m(b)
$$
and such that $\bigoplus A_n$ becomes an associative and unital
$R$-algebra, or
\item a cochain complex $A^\bullet$ of $R$-modules endowed with
$R$-bilinear maps $A^n \times A^m \to A^{n + m}$, $(a, b) \mapsto ab$
such that
$$
d^{n + m}(ab) = d^n(a)b + (-1)^n ad^m(b)
$$
and such that $\bigoplus A^n$ becomes an associative and unital $R$-algebra.
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

\noindent
We often just write $A = \bigoplus A_n$ or $A = \bigoplus A^n$ and
think of this as an associative unital $R$-algebra endowed with a
$\mathbf{Z}$-grading and an additive operator $d$ whose square is zero and
which satisfies the Leibniz rule as explained above. In this case
we often say ``Let $(A, d)$ be a differential graded algebra''.

\begin{definition}
\label{definition-homomorphism-dga}
A {\it homomorphism of differential graded algebras}
$f : (A, d) \to (B, d)$ is an algebra map $f : A \to B$
compatible with the gradings and $d$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
\label{definition-cdga}
A differential graded algebra $(A, d)$ is {\it commutative} if
$ab = (-1)^{nm}ba$ for $a$ in degree $n$ and $b$ in degree $m$.
We say $A$ is {\it strictly commutative} if in addition $a^2 = 0$
for $\deg(a)$ odd.
\end{definition}

\noindent
The following definition makes sense in general but is perhaps
``correct'' only when tensoring commutative differential graded
algebras.

\begin{definition}
\label{definition-tensor-product}
Let $R$ be a ring.
Let $(A, d)$, $(B, d)$ be differential graded algebras over $R$.
The {\it tensor product differential graded algebra} of $A$ and $B$
is the algebra $A \otimes_R B$ with multiplication defined by
$$
(a \otimes b)(a' \otimes b') = (-1)^{\deg(a')\deg(b)} aa' \otimes bb'
$$
endowed with differential $d$ defined by the rule
$d(a \otimes b) = d(a) \otimes b + (-1)^m a \otimes d(b)$
where $m = \deg(b)$.
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-total-complex-tensor-product}
Let $R$ be a ring.
Let $(A, d)$, $(B, d)$ be differential graded algebras over $R$.
Denote $A^\bullet$, $B^\bullet$ the underlying cochain complexes.
As cochain complexes of $R$-modules we have
$$
(A \otimes_R B)^\bullet = \text{Tot}(A^\bullet \otimes_A B^\bullet).
$$
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Recall that the differential of the total complex is given by
$d_1^{p, q} + (-1)^p d_2^{p, q}$ on $A^p \otimes_R B^q$.
And this is exactly the same as the rule for the differential
on $A \otimes_R B$ in
Definition \ref{definition-tensor-product}.
\end{proof}
