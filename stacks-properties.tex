\section{Introduction}
\label{section-introduction}

\noindent
Please see
Algebraic Stacks, Section \ref{algebraic-section-introduction}
for a brief introduction to algebraic stacks, and please read
some of that chapter for our foundations of algebraic stacks.
The intent is that in that chapter we are careful to distinguish
between schemes, algebraic spaces, algebraic stacks, and starting
with this chapter we employ the customary abuse of language where
all of these concepts are used interchangeably.

\medskip\noindent
The goal of this chapter is to introduce some basic notions and
properties of algebraic spaces. A fundamental
reference for the case of quasi-separated algebraic stacks with representable
diagonal is \cite{LM-B}.



\section{Conventions and abuse of language}
\label{section-conventions}

\noindent
We choose a big fppf site $\textit{Sch}_{fppf}$.
All schemes are contained in $\textit{Sch}_{fppf}$.
And all rings $A$ considered have the property that
$\text{Spec}(A)$ is (isomorphic) to an object of this big site.

\medskip\noindent
We also fix a base scheme $S$, by the conventions above an element
of $\textit{Sch}_{fppf}$. The reader who is only interested
in the absolute case can take $S = \text{Spec}(\mathbf{Z})$.

\medskip\noindent
Here are our conventions regarding algebraic stacks:
\begin{enumerate}
\item When we say {\it algebraic stack} we will mean an algebraic
stacks over $S$, i.e., a category fibred in groupoids
$p : \mathcal{X} \to (\textit{Sch}/S)_{fppf}$
which satisfies the conditions of
Algebraic Stacks, Definition \ref{algebraic-definition-algebraic-stack}.
\item We will say $f : \mathcal{X} \to \mathcal{Y}$ is a
{\it morphism of algebraic stacks} to indicate a $1$-morphism
of algebraic stacks over $S$, i.e., a $1$-morphism of categories fibred
in groupoids over $(\textit{Sch}/S)_{fppf}$, see
Algebraic Stacks,
Definition \ref{algebraic-definition-morphism-algebraic-stacks}.
\item A {\it $2$-morphism} $\alpha : f \to g$ will
indicate a $2$-morphism in the $2$-category of algebraic stacks over
$S$, see
Algebraic Stacks,
Definition \ref{algebraic-definition-morphism-algebraic-stacks}.
\item Given morphisms $\mathcal{X} \to \mathcal{Z}$
and $\mathcal{Y} \to \mathcal{Z}$ of algebraic stacks
we abusively call the $2$-fibre product
$\mathcal{X} \times_{\mathcal{Z}} \mathcal{Y}$ the {\it fibre product}.
\item We will often abuse notation and say two algebraic stacks
$\mathcal{X}$ and $\mathcal{Y}$ are {\it isomorphic} if they are
equivalent in this $2$-category.
\end{enumerate}

\medskip\noindent
Here are our conventions regarding algebraic spaces.
\begin{enumerate}
\item If we say $X$ is an {\it algebraic space} then we mean that
$X$ is an algebraic space over $S$, i.e., $X$ is a presheaf on
$(\textit{Sch}/S)_{fppf}$ which satisfies the conditions of
Spaces, Definition \ref{spaces-definition-algebraic-space}.
\item We will {\bf not} distinguish between an algebraic space $X$
and the algebraic stack $\mathcal{S}_X \to (\textit{Sch}/S)_{fppf}$
it gives rise to, see
Algebraic Stacks, Lemma \ref{algebraic-lemma-representable-algebraic}.
\item In particular, a {\it morphism} $f : X \to \mathcal{Y}$ from $X$
to an algebraic stack $\mathcal{Y}$ means a morphism
$f : \mathcal{S}_X \to \mathcal{Y}$ of algebraic stacks.
Similarly for morphisms $\mathcal{Y} \to X$.
\item Moreover, given an algebraic stack $\mathcal{X}$ we say
{\it $\mathcal{X}$ is an algebraic space} to indicate that $\mathcal{X}$
is representable by an algebraic space, see
Algebraic Stacks,
Definition \ref{algebraic-definition-representable-by-algebraic-space}.
\item We will use the following notational convention: If we
indicate an algebraic stack by a roman capital
(such as $X, Y, Z, A, B, \ldots$) then it will be the case that
its inertia stack is trivial, and hence it is an algebraic space, see
Algebraic Stacks,
Proposition \ref{algebraic-proposition-algebraic-stack-no-automorphisms}.
\end{enumerate}

\medskip\noindent
Here are our conventions regarding schemes.
\begin{enumerate}
\item If we say $X$ is a {\it scheme} then we mean that
$X$ is a scheme over $S$, i.e., $X$ is an object of $(\textit{Sch}/S)_{fppf}$.
\item We will {\bf not} distinguish between a scheme $X$ and the
algebraic stack $\mathcal{S}_X \to (\textit{Sch}/S)_{fppf}$ it gives rise
to, see
Algebraic Stacks, Lemma \ref{algebraic-lemma-representable-algebraic}.
\item In particular, a {\it morphism} $f : X \to \mathcal{Y}$ from
a scheme $X$ to an algebraic stack $\mathcal{Y}$ means a morphism
$f : \mathcal{S}_X \to \mathcal{Y}$ of algebraic stacks.
Similarly for morphisms $\mathcal{Y} \to X$.
\item Moreover, given an algebraic stack $\mathcal{X}$ we say
{\it $\mathcal{X}$ is a scheme} to indicate that $\mathcal{X}$
is representable, see
Algebraic Stacks, Section \ref{algebraic-section-representable}.
\end{enumerate}

\medskip\noindent
Here are our conventions regarding morphism of algebraic stacks:
\begin{enumerate}
\item We say a morphism $f : \mathcal{X} \to \mathcal{Y}$
of algebraic stacks is {\it representable}, or sometimes
{\it representable by schemes} if for every scheme
$T$ and morphism $T \to \mathcal{Y}$ the fibre product
$T \times_{\mathcal{Y}} \mathcal{X}$ is a scheme.
See
Algebraic Stacks, Section \ref{algebraic-section-representable-morphism}.
\item We say a morphism $f : \mathcal{X} \to \mathcal{Y}$
of algebraic stacks is {\it representable by algebraic spaces}
if for every scheme $T$ and morphism $T \to \mathcal{Y}$ the fibre product
$T \times_{\mathcal{Y}} \mathcal{X}$ is an algebraic space.
