\label{section-classics}

\begin{list}{}{\leftmargin=0em}
\item Mumford: \emph{Picard groups of moduli problems} 
\cite{mumford_picard}
\begin{quote}
Mumford never uses the term ``stack'' here but the 
concept is implicit in the paper; he computes the picard group of the moduli 
stack of elliptic curves.
\end{quote}
\item Deligne, Mumford: \emph{The irreducibility of the space of curves of 
given genus} \cite{deligne-mumford}
\begin{quote}
This influential paper introduces ``algebraic stacks'' in the 
sense which are now universally called Deligne-Mumford stacks (stacks with 
representable diagonal which admit \'etale presentations by schemes). There 
are many foundational results \emph{without proof}. The paper uses stacks to 
give two proofs of the irreducibility of the moduli space of curves of genus g. 
\end{quote}
\item Artin: {\em Versal deformations and algebraic stacks} 
\cite{artin_versal}
\begin{quote}
In this paper we find "algebraic stacks" which generalize 
Deligne-Mumford stacks and are now commonly referred to as
\emph{Artin stacks}. These are
stacks with representable diagonal which admit smooth presentations by schemes.
This paper gives deformation-theoretic criterion known as Artin's criterion 
which allows one to prove that a given moduli stack is an Artin stack without 
explicitly exhibiting a presentation.

\section{Books and online notes}
\label{section-books}


\begin{list}{}{\leftmargin=0em}
\item Laumon, Moret-Bailly: \emph{Champs Algebriques} \cite{lmb}
\begin{quote}
This book is currently the most exhaustive reference on stacks containing many 
foundational results. It assumes the reader is comfortable with algebraic 
spaces and frequently references Knutson's book \cite{knutson}. It has an 
error in chapter 12 concerning the functoriality of the lisse-\'etale site of 
an algebraic stack. One doesn't need to worry about this as the error has been 
patched by Martin Olsson (see \cite{olsson_sheaves}) and the results in the 
remaining chapters (after perhaps slight modification) are correct.
\end{quote}
\item The stacks project authors: \emph{The stacks project}
\cite{stacks_project}.
\begin{quote}
You are reading it!
\end{quote}
\item Anton Geraschenko:
\emph{Lecture notes for Martin Olsson's class on stacks} \cite{olsson_stacks}
\begin{quote}
This course systematically develops the theory of algebraic 
spaces before introducing algebraic stacks (first defined in Lecture 27!). In 
addition to basic properties, the course covers the equivalence between being 
Deligne-Mumford and having unramified diagonal, the lisse-\;etale site on an 
Artin stack, the theory of quasi-coherent sheaves, the Keel-Mori theorem, 
cohomological descent, and gerbes (and their relation to the Brauer group). 
There are also some exercises.
\end{quote}
\item
Behrend, Conrad, Edidin, Fantechi, Fulton, G\"ottsche, and Kresch:
\emph{Algebraic stacks}, online notes for a book being currently written
\cite{stacks_book}
\begin{quote}
The aim of this book is to give a friendly introduction to stacks without 
assuming a sophisticated background with a focus on examples and applications. 
Unlike \cite{lmb}, it is not assumed that the reader has digested the theory of 
algebraic spaces. Instead, Deligne-Mumford stacks are introduced with 
algebraic spaces being a special case with part of the goal being to develop 
enough theory to prove the assertions in \cite{deligne-mumford}. The general 
theory of Artin stacks is to be developed in the second part. Only a fraction 
of the book is now available on Kresch's website.

of abelian groups on $X$, then in the same way $H^1(X,G)$ can be identified 
with $G$-torsors, $H^2(X,G)$ can be identified with an appropriately defined 
set of $G$-gerbes. When $G$ is not abelian, then $H^2(X,G)$ is defined as the 
set of $G$-gerbes.

\section{Papers in the literature}
\label{section-papers}

\noindent
Below is a list of research papers which contain fundamental results on stacks 
and algebraic spaces. The intention of the summaries is to indicate only the 
results of the paper which contribute toward stack theory; in many cases these 
results are subsidiary to the main goals of the paper. We divide the papers 
into categories.

\medskip\noindent
{\bf Deformation theory and algebraic stacks.}
The first three papers by Artin do not contain anything on stacks but they 
contain powerful results with the first two papers being essential for 
\cite{artin_versal}.

\begin{list}{}{\leftmargin=0em}
\item Artin: \emph{Algebraic approximation of structures over 
complete local rings} \cite{artin_approximation}
\begin{quote}
It is proved that under mild hypotheses any effective formal deformation can be 
approximated: if $F: (\textit{Sch}/S) \to (\textit{Sets})$
is a contravariant functor 
locally of finite presentation with $S$ finite type over a field or excellent 
DVR, $s \in S$, and $\hat{\xi} \in F(\hat{\mathcal{O}}_{S,s})$ is an effective 
formal 
deformation, then for any $n > 0$, there exists an residually trivial \'etale 
neighborhood $(S',s') \to (S,s)$ and $\xi' \in F(S')$ such that $\xi'$ and 
$\hat{\xi}$ agree up to order $n$ (ie. have the same restriction in
$F(\mathcal{O}_{S,s} / \mathfrak m^n)$).
\end{quote}
\item
Artin: \emph{Algebraization of formal moduli I} \cite{artin_algebraizationI}
\begin{quote}
It is proved that under mild hypotheses any effective formal versal deformation 
is algebraizable. Let $F: (\textit{Sch}/S) \to (\textit{Sets})$ be a 
contravariant functor 
locally of finite presentation with $S$ finite type over a field or excellent 
DVR, $s \in S$ be a locally closed point , $\hat A$ be a complete noetherian 
local $\mathcal{O}_S$-algebra with residue field $k'$ a finite extension of 
$k(s)$, 
and $\hat{\xi} \in F(\hat A)$ be an effective formal versal deformation of an 
element $\xi_0 \in F(k')$. Then there is a scheme $X$ finite type over $S$ and 
a closed point $x \in X$ with residue field $k(x) = k'$ and an element $\xi \in 
F(X)$ such that there is an isomorphism $\hat{\mathcal{O}}_{X,x} \cong \hat{A}$ 
identifying the restrictions of $\xi$ and $\hat{\xi}$ in each $F(\hat A / 
\mathfrak m^n)$. The algebraization is unique if $\hat{\xi}$ is a universal 
deformation. Applications are given to the representability of the Hilbert
and Picard schemes.
\end{quote}
\item Artin: \emph{Algebraization of formal moduli. II} 
(\cite{artin_algebraizationII})
\begin{quote}
Vaguely, it is shown that if one can contract a closed subset $Y' \subseteq X'$ 
formally locally around $Y'$, then exists a global morphism $X' \to X$ 
contracting $Y$ with $X$ an algebraic space. 
\end{quote}
\item
Artin: \emph{Versal deformations and algebraic stacks} \cite{artin_versal}
\begin{quote}
This momentous paper mentioned above builds on his work in 
\cite{artin_approximation} and \cite{artin_algebraizationI}. This paper 
introduces Artin's criterion which allows one to algebraicity of a stack by 
verifying deformation-theoretic properties. More precisely (but not very 
precisely), Artin constructs a presentation of a limit preserving stack 
$\mathcal{X}$ 
locally around a point $x \in \mathcal{X}(k)$ as follows: assuming stack the 
$\mathcal{X}$ 
satisfies Schlessinger's criterion(\cite{schlessinger}), there exists a formal 
versal deformation $\hat{\xi} \in \lim \mathcal{X}(\hat A / \mathfrak m^n)$ of 
$x$. Assuming 
that formal deformations are effective (ie. $\mathcal{X}(\hat{A}) \to \lim 
\mathcal{X}(\hat A 
/ \mathfrak m^n)$ is bijective), then one obtains an effective formal versal 
deformation $\xi \in \mathcal{X}(\hat A)$. Using results in 
\cite{artin_algebraizationI}, one produces a finite type scheme $U$ and an 
element $\xi_U: U \to \mathcal{X}$ which is formally versal at a point $u \in 
U$ over 
$x$. Then if we assume $\mathcal{X}$ admits a deformation and obstruction 
theory 
satisfying certain conditions (ie. compatibility with \'etale localization and 
completion as well as constructibility condition), then it is shown in section 
4 that formal versality is an open condition so that after shrinking $U$, $U 
\to \mathcal{X}$ is smooth.
Artin also presents a proof that any stack that admits an fppf presentation by 
a scheme also admits a smooth presentation by a scheme so that in particular 
one can form quotient stacks by flat, separated, finitely presented group 
schemes.
\end{quote}
\item Conrad, de Jong: \emph{Approximation of Versal Deformations} 
\cite{conrad-dejong}
\begin{quote}
This paper offers an approach to Artin's algebraization result by applying 
Popescu's powerful result: if $A$ is a noetherian ring and $B$ a noetherian 
$A$-algebra, then the map $A \to B$ is a regular morphism if and only if $B$ 
is a direct limit of smooth $A$-algebras. It is not hard to see that Popescu's 
result implies Artin's approximation over an arbitrary excellent scheme (the 
excellence hypothesis implies that for a local ring $A$, the map $A^{\text{h}} 
\to \hat A$ from the henselization to the completion is regular).
The paper uses Popescu's result to give a ``groupoid'' generalization of the 
main theorem in \cite{artin_algebraizationI} which is valid over arbitrary
excellent base schemes and for arbitrary points $s \in S$. 
In particular, the results in \cite{artin_versal} hold under an arbitrary 
excellent base. They discuss the \'etale-local uniqueness of the 
algebraization and whether the automorphism group of the object acts naturally 
on the henselization of the algebraization.
\end{quote}
\item Jason Starr: \emph{Artin's axioms, composition, and moduli 
spaces} \cite{starr_artin}
\begin{quote}
The paper establishes that Artin's axioms for algebraization are compatible 
with the composition of 1-morphisms.
\end{quote}
\item Martin Olsson: \emph{Deformation theory of representable 
morphism of algebraic stacks} \cite{olsson_deformation}
\begin{quote}
This generalizes standard deformation theory results for morphisms of schemes 
to representable morphisms of algebraic stacks in terms of the cotangent 
complex. These results cannot be viewed as consequences of Illusie's general 
theory as the cotangent complex of a representable morphism $X \to \mathcal{X}$ 
is not 
defined in terms of cotangent complex of a morphism of ringed topoi (because 
the lisse-\'etale site is not functorial).
\end{quote}
\end{list}


\medskip\noindent
{\bf Coarse moduli spaces.}

\begin{list}{}{\leftmargin=0em}
\item Keel, Mori: \emph{Quotients in Groupoids} \cite{keel-mori}
\begin{quote}
It had apparently long been ``folklore'' that separated Deligne-Mumford stacks 
admitted coarse moduli spaces. A rigorous (although terse) proof of the 
following theorem is presented here: if $\mathcal{X}$ is an Artin stack 
locally of 
finite type over a noetherian base scheme such that the inertia stack 
$I_{\mathcal{X}} 
\to \mathcal{X}$ is finite, then there exists a coarse moduli space $\phi: 
\mathcal{X} \to Y$ 
with $\phi$ separated and $Y$ an algebraic space locally of finite type over 
$S$. The hypothesis that the inertia is finite is precisely the right 
condition: there exists a coarse moduli space $\phi: \mathcal{X} \to Y$ with 
$\phi$ 
separated if and only if the inertia is finite. 
\end{quote}
\item Conrad: \emph{The Keel-Mori Theorem via Stacks} \cite{conrad} 
\begin{quote}
Keel and Mori's paper \cite{keel-mori} is written in the groupoid language and 
some find it challenging to grasp. Brian Conrad presents a stack-theoretic 
version of the proof which is quite transparent although it uses the 
sophisticated language of stacks. Conrad also removes the noetherian 
hypothesis.
\end{quote}
\item Rydh: \emph{Existence of quotients by finite groups and coarse moduli
spaces} \cite{rydh_quotients}
\begin{quote}
Rydh removes the hypothesis from \cite{keel-mori} and \cite{conrad} that 
$\mathcal{X}$ 
be finitely presented over some base. 
\end{quote}
\item
Abramovich, Olsson, Vistoli: \emph{Tame stacks in positive characteristic} 
\cite{tame}
\begin{quote}
They define a \emph{tame Artin stack} as an Artin stack with finite inertia 
such that if $\phi: \mathcal{X} \to Y$ is the coarse moduli space, $\phi_*$ is 
exact 
on quasi-coherent sheaves. They prove that for an Artin stack with finite 
inertia, the following are equivalent: $\mathcal{X}$ is tame $\iff$ the 
stabilizers of 
$\mathcal{X}$ are linearly reductive $\iff$ $\mathcal{X}$ is \'etale locally on 
the coarse 
moduli space a quotient of an affine scheme by a linearly reductive group 
scheme. For a tame Artin stack, the coarse moduli space is particularly nice. 
For instance, the coarse moduli space commutes with arbitrary base change while 
a general coarse moduli space for an Artin stack with finite inertia will only 
commute with flat base change.
\end{quote}
\item Alper: \emph{Good moduli spaces for Artin stacks} \cite{alper_good}
\begin{quote}
For general Artin stacks with infinite affine stabilizer groups (which are 
necessarily non-separated), coarse moduli spaces often do not exist. The 
simplest example is $[\mathbf{A}^1 / \mathbf{G}_m]$. It is defined here that a 
quasi-compact 
morphism $\phi: \mathcal{X} \to Y$ is a \emph{good moduli space} if 
$\mathcal{O}_Y \to \phi_* 
\mathcal{O}_{\mathcal{X}}$ is an isomorphism and $\phi_*$ is exact on 
quasi-coherent sheaves. 
This notion generalizes a tame Artin stack in \cite{tame} as well as 
encapsulates Mumford's geometric invariant theory: if $G$ is a reductive group 
acting linearly on $X \subseteq \mathbf{P}^n$, then the morphism from the 
quotient 
stack of the semi-stable locus to the GIT quotient $[X^{ss}/G] \to X//G$ is a 
good moduli space. The notion of a good moduli space has many nice geometric 
properties: (1) $\phi$ is surjective, universally closed, and universally 
submersive, (2) $\phi$ identifies points in $Y$ with points in $\mathcal{X}$ up 
to 
closure equivalence, (3) $\phi$ is universal for maps to algebraic spaces, (4) 
good moduli spaces are stable under arbitrary base change, and (5) a vector 
bundle on an Artin stack descends to the good moduli space if and only if the 
representations are trivial at closed points.
\end{quote}
\end{list}

\medskip\noindent
{\bf Intersection theory.}

\begin{list}{}{\leftmargin=0em}
\item
Vistoli: \emph{Intersection theory on algebraic stacks and on their moduli 
spaces} \cite{vistoli_intersection}
\begin{quote}
This paper develops the foundations for intersection theory with rational 
coefficients for Deligne-Mumford stacks. If $\mathcal{X}$ is a separated 
Deligne-Mumford stack, the chow group $A_*(\mathcal{X})$ with rational 
coefficients is 
defined as the free abelian group of integral closed substacks of dimension $k$ 
up to rational equivalence. There is a flat pullback, a proper push-forward 
and a generalized Gysin homomorphism for regular local embedding. If $\phi: 
\mathcal{X} \to Y$ is a moduli space (ie. a proper morphism with is bijective 
on 
geometric points), there is an induced push-forward $A_*(\mathcal{X}) \to 
A_k(Y)$ 
which is an isomorphism. 
\end{quote}
\item Edidin, Graham: \emph{Equivariant Intersection Theory} 
\cite{edidin-graham}
\begin{quote}
The purpose of this article is to develop intersection theory with integral 
coefficients for a quotient stack $[X/G]$ of an action of an algebraic group 
$G$ on an algebraic space $X$ or, in other words, to develop an $G$-equivariant 
intersection theory of $X$. Equivariant chow groups defined using only 
invariant cycles does not produce a theory with nice properties. Instead, 
generalizing Totaro's definition in the case of $BG$ and motivated by the fact 
that if $V \to X$ is a vector bundle then $A_i(X) = A_i(V)$ naturally, the 
authors define $A_i^G(X)$ as follows:
Let $\dim(X) = n$ and $\dim(G) = g$. For each $i$, choose a $l$-dimensional 
$G$-representation $V$ where $G$ acts freely on an open subset $U \subseteq V$ 
whose complement as codimension $d > n-i$. So $X_G= [X \times U / G]$ is an 
algebraic space (it can even be chosen to be a scheme). Then they define 
$A_i^G(X) = A_{i+l-g}(X_G)$. For the quotient stack, one defines $A_i( [X/G]) 
:= A_{i+g}^G(X) = A_{i+l}(X_G)$. In particular, $A_i([X/G]) = 0$ for $i > \dim 
[X/G] = n - g$ but can be non-zero for $i << 0$ (eg. $A_i(B \mathbf{G}_m) = 
\mathbf{Z}$ for 
$i \le 0$).
They establish that these equivariant Chow groups enjoy the same functorial 
properties as ordinary Chow groups. Furthermore, they establish that if $[X / 
G] \cong [Y / H]$ that $A_i([X/G]) = A_i([Y/H])$ so that the definition is 
independent on how the stack is presented as a quotient stack.
\end{quote}
\item
Kresch: \emph{Cycle Groups for Artin Stacks} \cite{kresch_cycle}
\begin{quote}
Kresch defines Chow groups for arbitrary Artin stacks agreeing with Edidin and 
Graham's definition in \cite{edidin-graham} in the case of quotient stack. For 
algebraic stacks with affine stabilizer groups, the theory satisfies the usual 
properties. 
\end{quote}
\item Behrend and Fantechi: \emph{The intrinsic normal cone}
\cite{behrend-fantechi}
\begin{quote}
Generalizing a construction due to Li and Tian, Behrend and Fantechi construct 
a virtual fundamental class for a Deligne-Mumford stack.
\end{quote}
\end{list}

\medskip\noindent
{\bf Quotient stacks\footnote{In the literature,
\emph{quotient stack} often means a stack of the 
form $[X/G]$ with $X$ an algebraic space and $G$ a subgroup scheme
of $\text{GL}_n$ rather than an arbitrary flat group scheme.}.}
form a very important subclass of Artin stacks which include almost all moduli 
stacks studied by algebraic geometers. The geometry of a quotient stack 
$[X/G]$ is the $G$-equivariant geometry of $X$. It is often easier to show 
properties are true for quotient stacks and some results are only known to be 
true for quotient stacks. The following papers address: When is an algebraic 
stack a global quotient stack? Is an algebraic stack ``locally'' a quotient 
stack?

\begin{list}{}{\leftmargin=0em}
\item Laumon, Moret-Bailly: \cite[Chapter 6]{lmb} 
\begin{quote}
Chapter 6 contains several facts about the local and global structure of 
algebraic stacks. It is proved that an algebraic stack $\mathcal{X}$ over $S$ 
is a 
quotient stack $[Y/G]$ with $Y$ an algebraic space (resp. scheme, resp. affine 
scheme) and $G$ a finite group if and only if there exists an algebraic space 
(resp. scheme, resp. affine scheme) $Y'$ and an finite \'etale morphism $Y' 
\to \mathcal{X}$. It is shown that any Deligne-Mumford stack over $S$ and $x: 
\text{Spec} K 
\to \mathcal{X}$ admits an representable, \'etale and separated morphism $\phi: 
[X/G] 
\to \mathcal{X}$ where $G$ is a finite group acting on an affine scheme over 
$S$ such 
that $\text{Spec} K = [X/G] \times_{\mathcal{X}} \text{Spec} K$. The existence 
of presentations 
with geometrically connected fibers is also discussed in detail.
\end{quote}
\item
Edidin, Hassett, Kresch, Vistoli:
\emph{Brauer Groups and Quotient stacks} \cite{ehkv}
\begin{quote}
The establish some fundamental although not very difficult facts concerning 
when a given algebraic stack (always assumed finite type over a noetherian 
scheme in this paper) is a quotient stack. For an algebraic stack 
$\mathcal{X}$: 
$\mathcal{X}$ is a quotient stack $\iff$ there exists a vector bundle $V \to 
\mathcal{X}$ such 
that for every geometric point, the stabilizer acts faithfully on the fiber 
$\iff$ there exists a vector bundle $V \to \mathcal{X}$ and a locally closed 
substack 
$V^0 \subseteq V$ such that $V^0$ is representable and surjects onto $F$. They 
establish that an algebraic stack is a quotient stack if there exists finite 
flat cover by an algebraic space. Any smooth Deligne-Mumford stack with 
generically trivial stabilizer is a quotient stack.
They show that a $\mathbf{G}_m$-gerbe over a noetherian scheme $X$ 
corresponding to 
$\beta \in H^2(X, \mathbf{G}_m)$ is a quotient stack if and only if $\beta$ is 
in the 
image of the Brauer map $\text{Br}(X) \to \text{Br}'(X)$. They use this to 
produce a 
non-separated Deligne-Mumford stack that is not a quotient stack. (The only 
known non-quotient stacks are non-separated.)
\end{quote}
\item Totaro: \emph{The resolution property for schemes and stacks} 
\cite{totaro_resolution}
\begin{quote}
A stack has the resolution property if every coherent sheaf is the quotient of 
a vector bundle. The first main theorem is that if $\mathcal{X}$ is a normal 
noetherian algebraic stack with affine stabilizer groups at closed points, then 
the following are equivalent: (1) $\mathcal{X}$ has the resolution property and 
(2) 
$\mathcal{X} = [Y/\text{GL}_n]$ with $Y$ quasi-affine. In the case 
$\mathcal{X}$ is finite type over 
a field, then (1) and (2) are equivalent to: (3) $\mathcal{X} = [\text{Spec} A 
/ G]$ with $G$ 
an affine group scheme finite type over $k$. The implication that quotient 
stacks have the resolution property was proven by Thomason.
The second main theorem is that if $\mathcal{X}$ is a smooth Deligne-Mumford 
stack over 
a field which has a finite and generically trivial stabilizer group 
$I_{\mathcal{X}} 
\to \mathcal{X}$ and whose coarse moduli space is a scheme with affine 
diagonal, then 
$\mathcal{X}$ has the resolution property. Another cool result states that if 
$\mathcal{X}$ is 
a noetherian algebraic stack satisfying the resolution property, then 
$\mathcal{X}$ has 
affine diagonal if and only if the closed points have affine stabilizer. 
\end{quote}
\item Kresch: \emph{On the Geometry of Deligne-Mumford Stacks} 
\cite{kresch_geometry}
\begin{quote}
This article summarizes general structure results of Deligne-Mumford 
stacks (of finite type over a field) and contains some interesting results 
concerning quotient stacks. It is shown that any smooth, separated, 
generically tame Deligne-Mumford stack with quasi-projective coarse moduli 
space is a quotient stack $[Y/G]$ with $Y$ quasi-projective and $G$ an 
algebraic group. If $\mathcal{X}$ is a Deligne-Mumford stack whose coarse 
moduli space 
is a scheme, then $\mathcal{X}$ is Zariski-locally a quotient stack if and only 
if it 
admits a Zariski-open covering by stack quotients of schemes by finite groups.
If $\mathcal{X}$ is a Deligne-Mumford stack proper over a field of 
characteristic 0 
with coarse moduli space $Y$, then: $Y$ is projective and $\mathcal{X}$ is a 
quotient 
stack $\iff$ $Y$ is projective and $\mathcal{X}$ possesses a generating sheaf 
$\iff$ 
$\mathcal{X}$ admits a closed embedding into a smooth proper DM stack with 
projective 
coarse moduli space. This motivates a definition that a Deligne-Mumford stack 
is \emph{projective} if there exists a closed embedding into a smooth, proper 
Deligne-Mumford stack with projective coarse moduli space.
\end{quote}
\item
Kresch, Vistoli \emph{On coverings of Deligne-Mumford stacks and surjectivity 
of the Brauer map} \cite{kresch-vistoli}
\begin{quote}
It is shown that in characteristic 0 and for a fixed $n$, the following two 
statements are equivalent: (1) Every smooth Deligne-Mumford stack of dimension 
$n$ is a quotient stack and (2) The Azumaya Brauer group coincides with the 
cohomological Brauer group for smooth schemes of dimension $n$.
\end{quote}
\item
Kresch: \emph{Cycle Groups for Artin Stacks} \cite{kresch_cycle}
\begin{quote}
It is shown that a reduced Artin stack finite type over a field with affine 
stabilizer groups admits a stratification by quotient stacks.
\end{quote}
\item Abramovich-Vistoli: \emph{Compactifying the space of stable maps}
\cite{abramovich-vistoli}
\begin{quote}
Lemma 2.2.3 establishes that for any separated Deligne-Mumford stack is 
\'etale-locally on the coarse moduli space a quotient stack $[U/G]$ where $U$ 
affine and $G$ a finite group. \cite[Theorem 2.12]{olsson_homstacks} shows in 
this argument $G$ is even the stabilizer group.

This paper shows that a tame Artin stack is \'etale locally on the coarse

It is conjectured that for an Artin stack $\mathcal{X}$ and a closed point $x 
\in \mathcal{X}$ 
with linearly reductive stabilizer, then there is an \'etale morphism $[V/G_x] 
\to \mathcal{X}$ with $V$ an algebraic space. Some evidence for this 
conjecture is 
given. A simple deformation theory argument (based on ideas in \cite{tame}) 
shows that it is true formally locally. A stack-theoretic proof of Luna's 
\'etale slice theorem is presented proving that for stacks 
$\mathcal{X}=[\text{Spec} A / G]$ 
with $G$ linearly reductive, then \'etale locally on the GIT quotient 
$\text{Spec} 
A^G$, $\mathcal{X}$ is a quotient stack by the stabilizer.

{\bf Existence of finite covers by schemes.}
The existence of finite covers of Deligne-Mumford stacks by schemes
is a very important result. In intersection theory on Deligne-Mumford
stacks, it is an essential ingredient in defining proper push-forward
for non-representable morphisms. non-representable. There are several
results about $\overline{\mathcal{M}_g}$ relying on the existence of a finite 
cover by a \emph{smooth} schemes which was proven by Looijenga.
The first result in this direction proved in the equivariant
setting is perhaps \cite[Theorem 6.1]{seshadri_quotients}.

their moduli spaces} \cite{vistoli_intersection}
\begin{quote}
If $\mathcal{X}$ is a Deligne-Mumford stack with a moduli space (ie. a proper 
morphism 
with is bijective on geometric points), then there exists a finite morphism $X 
\to \mathcal{X}$ from a scheme $X$.
\end{quote}
\item Laumon, Moret-Bailly: \cite[Chapter 16]{lmb} 
\begin{quote}
As an application of Zariski's main theorem, Theorem 16.6 establishes: if 
$\mathcal{X}$ is a Deligne-Mumford stack finite type over a noetherian scheme, 
then 
there exists a finite, surjective, generically \'etale morphism $Z \to 
\mathcal{X}$ 
with $Z$ a scheme. It is also shown in Corollary 16.6.2 that any noetherian 
normal algebraic space is isomorphic to the algebraic space quotient $X'/G$ for 
a finite group acting a normal scheme $X$.

Theorem 2.7 states:
if $\mathcal{X}$ is an algebraic stack of finite type over a 
noetherian ground scheme $S$, then the diagonal
$\mathcal{X} \to \mathcal{X} \times_S \mathcal{X}$ is 
quasi-finite if and only if there exists a finite surjective
morphism $X \to F$ from a scheme $X$.

It is proved here that any smooth, separated Deligne-Mumford stack finite type 
over a field with quasi-projective coarse moduli space admits a finite, flat 
cover by a smooth quasi-projective scheme.

\item Olsson: \emph{On proper coverings of Artin stacks} 
\cite{olsson_proper}
\begin{quote}
Proves that if $\mathcal{X}$ is an Artin stack separated
and finite type over $S$, then 
there exists a proper surjective morphism $X \to \mathcal{X}$ from a scheme $X$ 
quasi-projective over $S$. As an application, Olsson proves coherence and 
constructibility of direct image sheaves under proper morphisms. He also 
proves Grothendieck's existence theorem for proper Artin stacks.
