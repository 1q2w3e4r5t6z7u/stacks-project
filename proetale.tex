\section{Introduction}
\label{section-introduction}

\noindent
Most of the material in this chapter and more can be found in the preprint
\cite{BS}.

\medskip\noindent
The goal of this chapter is to introduce the pro-\'etale topology and
show how it simplifies the introduction of $\ell$-adic cohomology in
algebraic geometry.




\section{Ind-\'etale algebra}
\label{section-ind-etale}

\noindent
We start with a defintion.

\begin{definition}
\label{definition-ind-etale}
A ring map $A \to B$ is said to be {\it ind-\'etale} if $B$ can be written
as a filtered colimit of \'etale $A$-algebras.
\end{definition}

\noindent
The category of ind-\'etale algebras is closed under taking filtered colimits.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-ind-ind}
A filtered colimit of ind-\'etale $A$-algebras is ind-\'etale over $A$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Omitted.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-ind-permanence}
Let $A$ be a ring. Let $B \to C$ be an $A$-algebra map of ind-\'etale
$A$-algebras. Then $C$ is an ind-\'etale $B$-algebra.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Write $B = \colim B_i$ and $C = \colim C_j$ as filtered colimits
of \'etale $A$-algebras. Then
$$
C = B \otimes_B C = \colim_{(i, j)} B \otimes_{B_i} C_j
$$
where the colimit is over the partially ordered set of pairs $(i, j)$
such that $B_i \to B \to C$ factors through $C_j \to C$. Note that
the factorization $B_i \to C_j$ is \'etale by
Algebra, Lemma \ref{algebra-lemma-map-between-etale}.
Some details omitted.
\end{proof}

\noindent
Let $A$ be a ring. Recall that any \'etale ring map $A \to B$ is isomorphic
to a standard smooth ring map of relative dimension $0$. Such a ring map
is of the form
$$
A \longrightarrow A[x_1, \ldots, x_n]/(f_1, \ldots, f_n)
$$
where the determinant of the $n \times n$-matrix with entries
$\partial f_i/\partial x_j$ is invertible in the quotient ring. See
Algebra, Lemma \ref{algebra-lemma-etale-standard-smooth}.

\medskip\noindent
Let $S(A)$ be the set of all {\it faithfully flat}\footnote{In the presence
of flatness, e.g., for smooth or \'etale ring maps,
this just means that the induced map on spectra is surjective. See
Algebra, Lemma \ref{algebra-lemma-ff-rings}.}
standard smooth $A$-algebras of relative dimension $0$.
Let $I(A)$ be the partially ordered (by inclusion) set of finite
subsets $E$ of $S(A)$. Note that $I(A)$ is a directed partially
ordered set. For $E = \{A \to B_1, \ldots, A \to B_n\}$ set
$$
B_E = B_1 \otimes_A \ldots \otimes_A B_n
$$
Observe that $B_E$ is a faithfully flat \'etale $A$-algebra.
For $E \subset E'$, there is a canonical transition map $B_E \to B_{E'}$
of \'etale $A$-algebras. Namely, say $E = \{A \to B_1, \ldots, A \to B_n\}$
and $E' = \{A \to B_1, \ldots, A \to B_{n + m}\}$ then
$B_E \to B_{E'}$ sends $b_1 \otimes \ldots \otimes b_n$ to the
element $b_1 \otimes \ldots \otimes b_n \otimes 1 \otimes \ldots \otimes 1$
of $B_{E'}$. This construction defines a system of faithfully flat
\'etale $A$-algebras over $I(A)$ and we set
$$
T(A) = \colim_{E \in I(A)} B_E
$$
Observe that $T(A)$ is a faitfully flat ind-\'etale $A$-algebra
(Algebra, Lemma \ref{algebra-lemma-colimit-faithfully-flat}). By construction
given any faithfully flat \'etale $A$-algebra $B$ there is a (non-unique)
$A$-algebra map $B \to T(A)$. Namely, pick some $(A \to B_0) \in S(A)$ such
and an isomorphism $B \cong B_0$. Then the canonical coprojection
$$
B \to B_0 \to 
T(A) = \colim_{E \in I(A)} B_E
$$
is the desired map.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-first-construction}
Given a ring $A$ there exists a faithfully flat ind-\'etale $A$-algebra $C$
such that every faithfully flat \'etale ring map $C \to B$ has a section.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Set $T^1(A) = T(A)$ and $T^{n + 1}(A) = T(T^n(A))$. Let
$$
C = \colim T^n(A)
$$
This algebra is faithfully flat over each $T^n(A)$ and in particular
over $A$, see
Algebra, Lemma \ref{algebra-lemma-colimit-faithfully-flat}.
Moreover, $C$ is ind-\'etale over $A$ by Lemma \ref{lemma-ind-ind}.
If $C \to B$ is \'etale, then there exists an $n$ and an \'etale
ring map $T^n(A) \to B'$ such that $B = C \otimes_{T^n(A)} B'$, see
Algebra, Lemma \ref{algebra-lemma-etale}.
If $C \to B$ is faithfully flat, then $\Spec(B) \to \Spec(C) \to \Spec(T^n(A))$
is surjective, hence $\Spec(B') \to \Spec(T^n(A))$ is surjective.
In other words, $T^n(A) \to B'$ is faithfully flat.
By our construction, there is a $T^n(A)$-algebra map
$B' \to T^{n + 1}(A)$. This induces a $C$-algebra map $B \to C$
which finishes the proof.
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}
\label{remark-size-T}
Let $A$ be a ring. Let $\kappa$ be an infinite cardinal bigger or
equal than the cardinality of $A$. Then the cardinality of $T(A)$
is at most $\kappa$. Namely, each $B_E$ has cardinality at most
$\kappa$ and the index set $I(A)$ has cardinality at most $\kappa$
as well. Thus the result follows as $\kappa \otimes \kappa = \kappa$, see
Sets, Section \ref{sets-section-cardinals}. It follows that the
ring constructed in the proof of Lemma \ref{lemma-first-construction}
has cardinality at most $\kappa$ as well.
\end{remark}

\begin{remark}
\label{remark-first-construction-functorial}
The construction $A \mapsto T(A)$ is functorial in the following sense:
If $A \to A'$ is a ring map, then we can construct a commutative diagram
$$
\xymatrix{
A \ar[r] \ar[d] & T(A) \ar[d] \\
A' \ar[r] & T(A')
}
$$
Namely, given $(A \to A[x_1, \ldots, x_n]/(f_1, \ldots, f_n))$ in
$S(A)$ we can use the ring map $\varphi : A \to A'$ to obtain a corresponding
element $(A' \to A'[x_1, \ldots, x_n]/(f^\varphi_1, \ldots, f^\varphi_n))$
of $S(A')$ where $f^\varphi$ means the polynomial obtained by applying
$\varphi$ to the coefficients of the polynomial $f$.
Moreover, there is a commutative diagram
$$
\xymatrix{
A \ar[r] \ar[d] & A[x_1, \ldots, x_n]/(f_1, \ldots, f_n) \ar[d] \\
A' \ar[r] & A'[x_1, \ldots, x_n]/(f^\varphi_1, \ldots, f^\varphi_n)
}
$$
which is a in the category of rings. For $E \subset S(A)$ finite, set
$E' = \varphi(E)$ and define $B_E \to B_{E'}$ in the obvious manner.
Taking the colimit gives the desired map $T(A) \to T(A')$, see
Categories, Lemma \ref{categories-lemma-functorial-colimit}.
\end{remark}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-have-sections-quotient}
Let $A$ be a ring such that every faithfully flat \'etale ring map
$A \to B$ has a section. Then the same is true for every quotient ring
$A/I$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Omitted.
