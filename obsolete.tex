\section{Introduction}
\label{section-introduction}

\noindent
In this chapter we put some lemmas that have become ``obsolete''
(see \cite{Miller}).





\section{Lemmas related to ZMT}
\label{section-ZMT}

\noindent
The lemmas in this section were originally used in the proof of the
(algebraic version of) Zariski's Main Theorem,
Algebra, Theorem \ref{algebra-theorem-main-theorem}.

\medskip\noindent
The following two lemmas are a way of describing closed
subschemes of $\mathbf{P}^1_R$ cut out by one (nondegenerate)
equation.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-P1}
Let $R$ be a ring.
Let $F(X, Y) \in R[X, Y]$ be homogenous of degree
$d$. Assume that for every prime $\mathfrak p$ of $R$
at least one coefficient of $F$ is not in $\mathfrak p$.
Let $S = R[X, Y]/(F)$ as a graded ring.
Then for all $n \geq d$ the $R$-module $S_n$
is finite locally free of rank $d$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
The $R$-module $S_n$ has a presentation
$$
R[X, Y]_{n-d} \to R[X, Y]_n \to S_n \to 0.
$$
Thus by Algebra, Lemma \ref{algebra-lemma-cokernel-flat}
it is enough to show that multiplication
by $F$ induces an injective map
$\kappa(\mathfrak p)[X, Y]
\to \kappa(\mathfrak p)[X, Y]$
for all primes $\mathfrak p$.
This is clear from the assumption that
$F$ does not map to the zero polynomial mod $\mathfrak p$.
The assertion on ranks is clear from this as well.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-rel-prime-pols}
Let $k$ be a field. Let $F, G \in k[X, Y]$ be homogeneous
of degrees $d, e$. Assume $F, G$ relatively prime.
Then multiplication by $G$ is injective on $S = k[X, Y]/(F)$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
This is one way to define ``relatively prime''. If you have another
definition, then you can show it is equivalent to this one.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-P1-localize}
Let $R$ be a ring. Let $F(X, Y) \in R[X, Y]$ be homogenous of degree
$d$. Let $S = R[X, Y]/(F)$ as a graded ring.
Let $\mathfrak p \subset R$ be a prime such that
some coefficient of $F$ is not in $\mathfrak p$.
There exists an $f \in R$ $f \not\in \mathfrak p$,
an integer $e$, and a $G \in R[X, Y]_e$
such that multiplication by $G$ induces isomorphisms
$(S_n)_f \to (S_{n + e})_f$ for all $n \geq d$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
During the course of the proof we may replace $R$ by $R_f$
for $f\in R$, $f\not\in \mathfrak p$ (finitely often).
As a first step we do such a replacement such that
some coefficient of $F$ is invertible in $R$.
In particular the modules $S_n$ are now locally
free of rank $d$ for $n \geq d$ by Lemma \ref{lemma-P1}.
Pick any $G \in R[X, Y]_e$ such that the image of
$G$ in $\kappa(\mathfrak p)[X, Y]$ is relatively
prime to the image of $F(X, Y)$ (this is possible for some $e$).
Apply Algebra, Lemma \ref{algebra-lemma-cokernel-flat} to the map
induced by multiplication by $G$ from $S_d \to S_{d + e}$.
By our choice of $G$ and Lemma \ref{lemma-rel-prime-pols}
we see
$S_d \otimes \kappa(\mathfrak p) \to S_{d + e} \otimes \kappa(\mathfrak p)$
is bijective. Thus, after replacing $R$ by $R_f$ for a suitable
$f$ we may assume that $G : S_d \to S_{d + e}$
is bijective. This in turn implies that the image
of $G$ in $\kappa(\mathfrak p')[X, Y]$ is relatively
prime to the image of $F$ for all primes $\mathfrak p'$
of $R$. And then by Algebra, Lemma \ref{algebra-lemma-cokernel-flat}
again we see that all the maps
$G : S_d \to S_{d + e}$, $n \geq d$ are isomorphisms.
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}
\label{remark-algebra}
Let $R$ be a ring. Suppose that we have $F \in R[X, Y]_d$
and $G \in R[X, Y]_e$ such that, setting $S = R[X, Y]/(F)$
we have (1) $S_n$ is finite locally free of rank $d$ for
all $n \geq d$, and (2) multiplication by $G$ defines
ismorphisms $S_n \to S_{n + e}$ for all $n \geq d$. In this
case we may define a finite, locally free $R$-algebra
$A$ as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item as an $R$-module $A = S_{ed}$, and
\item multiplication $A \times A \to A$ is given by
the rule that $H_1 H_2 = H_3$ if and only if $G^d H_3 = H_1 H_2$
in $S_{2ed}$.
\end{enumerate}
This makes sense because multiplication by $G^d$
induces a bijective map $S_{de} \to S_{2de}$.
It is easy to see that this defines a ring structure.
Note the confusing fact that the element $G^d$
defines the unit element of the ring $A$.
\end{remark}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-finite-after-localization}
Let $R$ be a ring, let $f \in R$.
Suppose we have $S$, $S'$ and the solid arrows
forming the following commutative diagram of rings
$$
\xymatrix{
& S'' \ar@{-->}[rd] \ar@{-->}[dd] &
\\
R \ar[rr] \ar@{-->}[ru] \ar[d] &  & S \ar[d]
\\
R_f \ar[r] & S' \ar[r] & S_f
}
$$
Assume that $R_f \to S'$ is finite. Then we can find
a finite ring map $R \to S''$ and dotted arrows as
in the diagram such that $S' = (S'')_f$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Namely, suppose that $S'$ is generated by
$x_i$ over $R_f$, $i = 1, \ldots, w$. Let $P_i(t) \in R_f[t]$
be a monic polynomial such that $P_i(x_i) = 0$.
Say $P_i$ has degree $d_i > 0$. Write
$P_i(t) = t^{d_i} + \sum_{j < d_i} (a_{ij}/f^n) t^j$
for some uniform $n$. Also write
the image of $x_i$ in $S_f$ as $g_i / f^n$
for suitable $g_i \in S$. Then we know
that the element
$\xi_i = f^{nd_i} g_i^{d_i} + \sum_{j < d_i} f^{n(d_i - j)} a_{ij} g_i^j$
of $S$ is killed by a power of $f$.
Hence upon increasing $n$ to $n'$, which replaces
$g_i$ by $f^{n' - n}g_i$ we may assume $\xi_i = 0$.
Then $S'$ is generated by the elements
$f^n x_i$, each of which is a zero of the
monic polynomial $Q_i(t) = t^{d_i} +
\sum_{j < d_i} f^{n(d_i - j)} a_{ij} t^j$
with coefficients in $R$. Also, by construction
$Q_i(f^ng_i) = 0$ in $S$. Thus we get a finite $R$-algebra
$S'' = R[z_1, \ldots, z_w]/(Q_1(z_1), \ldots, Q_w(z_w))$
which fits into a commutative diagram as above.
The map $\alpha : S'' \to S$ maps $z_i$ to $f^ng_i$ and
the map $\beta : S'' \to S'$ maps $z_i$ to $f^nx_i$.
It may not yet be the case that $\beta$ induces an
isomorphism $(S'')_f \cong S'$.
For the moment we only know that this map
is surjective. The problem is that there could be
elements $h/f^n \in (S'')_f$ which map to zero
in $S'$ but are not zero. In this case $\beta(h)$
is an element of $S$ such that $f^N \beta(h) = 0$
for some $N$. Thus $f^N h$ is an element ot the ideal
$J = \{h \in S'' \mid \alpha(h) = 0 \text{ and }
\beta(h) = 0\}$ of $S''$. OK, and it is easy to see that
$S''/J$ does the job.
\end{proof}
