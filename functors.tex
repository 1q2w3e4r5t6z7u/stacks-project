\section{Introduction}
\label{section-introduction}

\noindent
Let $X$ and $Y$ be schemes. In this chapter circles around the relationship
between functors $\QCoh(\mathcal{O}_Y) \to \QCoh(\mathcal{O}_X)$ and
morphisms of schemes $X \to Y$. More broadly speaking we study the
relationship between $\QCoh(\mathcal{O}_X)$ and $X$ or, if $X$ is Noetherian,
the relationship between $\textit{Coh}(\mathcal{O}_X)$ and $X$.
This relationship was studied in \cite{Gabriel}.







\section{Functors between categories of modules}
\label{section-functors}

\noindent
The following lemma is archetypical of the results in this chapter.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-functor}
Let $A$ and $B$ be rings. Let $F : \text{Mod}_A \to \text{Mod}_B$
be a functor. The following are equivalent
\begin{enumerate}
\item $F$ is isomorphic to the functor $M \mapsto M \otimes_A K$
for some $A \otimes_\mathbf{Z} B$-module $K$,
\item $F$ is right exact and commutes with all direct sums,
\item $F$ commutes with all colimits,
\item $F$ has a right adjoint $G$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
If (1), then (4) as a right adjoint for $M \mapsto M \otimes_A K$
is $N \mapsto \Hom_B(K, N)$, see
Differential Graded Algebra, Lemma \ref{dga-lemma-tensor-hom-adjunction}.
If (4), then (3) by Categories, Lemma \ref{categories-lemma-adjoint-exact}.
The implication (3) $\Rightarrow$ (2) is immediate from the definitions.

\medskip\noindent
Assume (2). We will prove (1). By the discussion in
Homology, Section \ref{homology-section-functors}
the functor $F$ is additive. Hence $F$ induces
a ring map $A \to \text{End}_B(F(M))$, $a \mapsto F(a \cdot \text{id}_M)$
for every $A$-module $M$. We conclude that $F(M)$ is an
$A \otimes_\mathbf{Z} B$-module functorially in $M$.
Set $K = F(A)$. Define
$$
M \otimes_A K = M \otimes_A F(A) \longrightarrow F(M),
\quad m \otimes k \longmapsto F(\varphi_m)(k)
$$
Here $\varphi_m : A \to M$ sends $a \to am$. The rule
$(m, k) \mapsto F(\varphi_m)(k)$ is $A$-bilinear (and $B$-linear
on the right) as required to obtain the displayed
$A \otimes_\mathbf{Z} B$-linear map.
This construction is functorial in $M$, hence defines a transformation
of functors $- \otimes_A K \to F(-)$ which is an isomorphism when
evaluated on $A$. For every $A$-module $M$ we can choose an exact sequence
$$
\bigoplus\nolimits_{j \in J} A \to
\bigoplus\nolimits_{i \in I} A \to
M \to 0
$$
Using the maps constructed above we find a commutative diagram
$$
\xymatrix{
(\bigoplus\nolimits_{j \in J} A) \otimes_A K \ar[r] \ar[d] &
(\bigoplus\nolimits_{i \in I} A) \otimes_A K \ar[r] \ar[d] &
M \otimes_A K \ar[r] \ar[d] &
0 \\
F(\bigoplus\nolimits_{j \in J} A) \ar[r] &
F(\bigoplus\nolimits_{i \in I} A) \ar[r] &
F(M) \ar[r] &  0
}
$$
The lower row is exact as $F$ is right exact.
The upper row is exact as tensor product with $K$ is right exact.
Since $F$ commutes with direct sums the left two vertical arrows
are bijections. Hence we conclude.
\end{proof}

\begin{example}
\label{example-functor-modules}
Let $R$ be a ring. Let $A$ and $B$ be $R$-algebras. Let $K$ be a
$A \otimes_R B$-module. Then we can consider the functor
\begin{equation}
\label{equation-FM-modules}
F : \text{Mod}_A \longrightarrow \text{Mod}_B,\quad
M \longmapsto M \otimes_A K
\end{equation}
This functor is $R$-linear, right exact,
commutes with arbitrary direct sums, commutes
with all colimits, has a right adjoint (Lemma \ref{lemma-functor}).
\end{example}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-functor-modules}
Let $R$ be a ring. Let $A$ and $B$ be $R$-algebras. There is an
equivalence of categories between
\begin{enumerate}
\item the category of $R$-linear functors
$F : \text{Mod}_A \to \text{Mod}_B$ which
are right exact and commute with arbitrary direct sums, and
\item the category $\text{Mod}_{A \otimes_R B}$.
\end{enumerate}
given by sending $K$ to the functor $F$ in (\ref{equation-FM-modules}).
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Let $F$ be an object of the first category. By
Lemma \ref{lemma-functor} we may assume $F(M) = M \otimes_A K$
functorially in $M$ for some $A \otimes_\mathbf{Z} B$-module $K$.
The $R$-linearity of $F$ immediately implies that the
$A \otimes_\mathbf{Z} B$-module structure on $K$ comes
from a (unique) $A \otimes_R B$-module structure on $K$.
Thus we see that sending $K$ to $F$ as in (\ref{equation-FM-modules})
is essentially surjective.

\medskip\noindent
To prove that our functor is fully faithful, we have to show that
given $A \otimes_R B$-modules $K$ and $K'$ any transformation
$t : F \to F'$ between the corresponding functors, comes from
a unique $\varphi : K \to K'$. Since $K = F(A)$ and $K' = F'(A)$
we can take $\varphi$ to be the value $t_A : F(A) \to F'(A)$
of $t$ at $A$. This maps is $A \otimes_R B$-linear by the
definition of the $A \otimes B$-module structure on $F(A)$
and $F'(A)$ given in the proof of Lemma \ref{lemma-functor}.
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}
\label{remark-composition}
Let $R$ be a ring. Let $A$, $B$, $C$ be $R$-algebras.
Let $F : \text{Mod}_A \to \text{Mod}_B$ and
$F' : \text{Mod}_B \to \text{Mod}_C$ be
$R$-linear, right exact functors which commute with arbitrary direct sums.
If by the equivalence of Lemma \ref{lemma-functor-modules} the object
$K$ in $\text{Mod}_{A \otimes_R B}$ corresponds to $F$ and the object
$K'$ in $\text{Mod}_{B \otimes_R C}$ corresponds to $F'$, then
$K \otimes_B K'$ viewed as an object of
$\text{Mod}_{A \otimes_R C}$ corresponds to $F' \circ F$.
\end{remark}

\begin{remark}
\label{remark-exact-flat}
In the situation of Lemma \ref{lemma-functor-modules}
suppose that $F$ corresponds to $K$. Then
$F$ is exact $\Leftrightarrow$ $K$ is flat over $A$.
\end{remark}

\begin{remark}
\label{remark-finite}
In the situation of Lemma \ref{lemma-functor-modules}
suppose that $F$ corresponds to $K$. Then
$F$ sends finite $A$-modules to finite $B$-modules
$\Leftrightarrow$ $K$ is finite as a $B$-module.
\end{remark}

\begin{remark}
\label{remark-finite-presentation}
In the situation of Lemma \ref{lemma-functor-modules}
suppose that $F$ corresponds to $K$. Then
$F$ sends finitely presented $A$-modules to finitely presented $B$-modules
$\Leftrightarrow$ $K$ is finitely presented as a $B$-module.
\end{remark}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-functor-equivalence}
Let $A$ and $B$ be rings. If
$$
F : \text{Mod}_A \longrightarrow \text{Mod}_B
$$
is an equivalence of categories, then there exists an isomorphism
$A \to B$ of rings and an invertible $B$-module $L$ such that
$F$ is isomorphic to the functor $M \mapsto (M \otimes_A B) \otimes_B L$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Since an equivalence commutes with all colimits, we see that
Lemmas \ref{lemma-functor} applies. Let $K$ be the
$A \otimes_\mathbf{Z} B$-module such that $F$ is
isomorphic to the functor $M \mapsto M \otimes_A K$.
Let $K'$ be the $B \otimes_\mathbf{Z} A$-module such that
a quasi-inverse of $F$ is
isomorphic to the functor $N \mapsto N \otimes_B K'$.
By Remark \ref{remark-composition} and
Lemma \ref{lemma-functor-modules} we have an isomorphism
$$
\psi : K \otimes_B K' \longrightarrow A
$$
of $A \otimes_\mathbf{Z} A$-modules.
Similarly, we have an isomorphism
$$
\psi' : K' \otimes_A K \longrightarrow B
$$
of $B \otimes_\mathbf{Z} B$-modules. Choose an element
$\xi = \sum_{i = 1, \ldots, n} x_i \otimes y_i \in K \otimes_B K'$
such that $\psi(\xi) = 1$. Consider the isomorphisms
$$
K \xrightarrow{\psi^{-1} \otimes \text{id}_K}
K \otimes_B K' \otimes_A K \xrightarrow{\text{id}_K \otimes \psi'} K
$$
The composition is an isomorphism and given by
$$
k \longmapsto \sum x_i \psi'(y_i \otimes k)
$$
We conclude this automorphism factors as
$$
K \to B^{\oplus n} \to K
$$
as a map of $B$-modules. It follows that $K$ is finite
projective as a $B$-module.

\medskip\noindent
We claim that $K$ is invertible as a $B$-module. This is equivalent
to asking the rank of $K$ as a $B$-module to have the constant value $1$,
see More on Algebra, Lemma \ref{more-algebra-lemma-invertible} and
Algebra, Lemma \ref{algebra-lemma-finite-projective}.
If not, then there exists a maximal ideal $\mathfrak m \subset B$
such that either (a) $K \otimes_B B/\mathfrak m = 0$ or
(b) there is a surjection $K \to (B/\mathfrak m)^{\oplus 2}$ of
$B$-modules. Case (a) is absurd as $K' \otimes_A K \otimes_B N = N$
for all $B$-modules $N$. Case (b) would imply we get a surjection
$$
A = K \otimes_B K' \longrightarrow (B/\mathfrak m \otimes_B K')^{\oplus 2}
$$
of (right) $A$-modules. This is impossible as the target is an $A$-module
which needs at least two generators: $B/\mathfrak m \otimes_B K'$
is nonzero as the image of the nonzero module $B/\mathfrak m$ under
the quasi-inverse of $F$.

\medskip\noindent
Since $K$ is invertible as a $B$-module we see that $\Hom_B(K, K) = B$.
Thus the $A$-module structure on $K$ defines a ring map
$A \to B$. The lemma follows.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-functor-equivalence-linear}
Let $R$ be a ring. Let $A$ and $B$ be $R$-algebras. If
$$
F : \text{Mod}_A \longrightarrow \text{Mod}_B
$$
is an $R$-linear equivalence of categories, then there exists an isomorphism
$A \to B$ of $R$-algebras and an invertible $B$-module $L$ such that
$F$ is isomorphic to the functor $M \mapsto (M \otimes_A B) \otimes_B L$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
We get $A \to B$ and $L$ from Lemma \ref{lemma-functor-equivalence}.
To finish the proof, we need to show that the $R$-linearity
of $F$ forces $A \to B$ to be an $R$-algebra map. We omit the details.
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}
\label{remark-monoidal}
Let $A$ and $B$ be rings. Let us endow $\text{Mod}_A$ and $\text{Mod}_B$
with the usual monoidal structure given by tensor products of modules.
Let $F : \text{Mod}_A \to \text{Mod}_B$ be a functor of
monoidal categories, see
Categories, Definition \ref{categories-definition-functor-monoidal-categories}.
Here are some comments:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Since $F(A)$ is a unit (by our definitions) we have $F(A) = B$.
\item We obtain a multiplicative map $\varphi : A \to B$
by sending $a \in A$ to its action on $F(A) = B$.
\item If $F$ is additive, then $\varphi$ is a ring map.
\item Take $A = B$ and $F(M) = M \otimes_A M$. In this case $\varphi(a) = a^2$.
\item If $F$ is right exact and commutes with direct sums,
then $F(M) = M \otimes_{A, \varphi} B$ by Lemma \ref{lemma-functor}
and the discussion so far.
\end{enumerate}
In other words, ring maps $A \to B$ are in bijection with isomorphism classes
of functors of monoidal categories $\text{Mod}_A \to \text{Mod}_B$
which commute with all colimits.
\end{remark}
