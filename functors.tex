\noindent
Let $X$ and $Y$ be schemes. In this chapter circles around the relationship
between functors $\QCoh(\mathcal{O}_Y) \to \QCoh(\mathcal{O}_X)$ and
morphisms of schemes $X \to Y$. More broadly speaking we study the
relationship between $\QCoh(\mathcal{O}_X)$ and $X$ or, if $X$ is Noetherian,
the relationship between $\textit{Coh}(\mathcal{O}_X)$ and $X$.
This relationship was studied in \cite{Gabriel}.
