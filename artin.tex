\section{Introduction}
\label{section-introduction}

\noindent
In this chapter we discuss Artin's axioms for the representability of
functors by algebraic spaces. As references we suggest the papers
\cite{ArtinI}, \cite{ArtinII}, \cite{ArtinVersal}.




\section{Conventions}
\label{section-conventions}

\noindent
The conventions we use in this chapter are the same as those in the
chapter on algebraic stacks, see
Algebraic Stacks, Section \ref{algebraic-section-conventions}.
In this chapter the base scheme $S$ will always be Noetherian
(although we will always reiterate this condition when stating
results).





\section{Predeformation categories and stacks in groupoids}
\label{section-stacks-and-predeformation-categories}

\noindent
Let $S$ be a Noetherian base scheme. Let
$$
p : \mathcal{X} \longrightarrow (\textit{Sch}/S)_{fppf}
$$
be a category fibred in groupoids. Let $k$ be a field
and let $\Spec(k) \to S$ be a morphism of finite type (see
Morphisms, Lemma \ref{morphisms-lemma-point-finite-type}). We will sometimes
simply say that {\it $k$ is a field of finite type over $S$}. Let
$x_0$ be an object of $\mathcal{X}$ lying over $\Spec(k)$.
Given $S$, $\mathcal{X}$, $k$, and $x_0$ we will construct a
predeformation category, as defined in 
Formal Deformation Theory,
Definition \ref{formal-defos-definition-predeformation-category}.
The construction will resemble to construction of
Formal Deformation Theory,
Remark \ref{formal-defos-remark-localize-cofibered-groupoid}.

\medskip\noindent
First, by Morphisms, Lemma \ref{morphisms-lemma-point-finite-type}
we may pick an affine open $\Spec(\Lambda) \subset S$ such that
$\Spec(k) \to S$ factors through $\Spec(\Lambda)$ and the associated
ring map $\Lambda \to k$ is finite. This provides us with the category
$\mathcal{C}_\Lambda$, see
Formal Deformation Theory, Definition \ref{formal-defos-definition-CLambda}.
The category $\mathcal{C}_\Lambda$, up to canonical equivalence,
does not depend on the choice of the affine open $\Spec(\Lambda)$ of $S$.
Namely, $\mathcal{C}_\Lambda$ is equivalent to the opposite
of the category of factorizations
\begin{equation}
\label{equation-factor}
\Spec(k) \to \Spec(A) \to S
\end{equation}
of the structure morphism such that $A$ is an Artinian local ring and
such that $\Spec(k) \to \Spec(A)$ corresponds to a ring map $A \to k$ which
identifies $k$ with the resisue field of $A$.

\medskip\noindent
We let $\mathcal{F} = \mathcal{F}_{\mathcal{X}, k, x_0}$ be the
category whose
\begin{enumerate}
\item objects are morphisms $x_0 \to x$ of $\mathcal{X}$ where
$p(x) = \Spec(A)$ with $A$ an Artinian local ring and
$p(x_0) \to p(x) \to S$ a factorization as in (\ref{equation-factor}), and
\item morphisms $(x_0 \to x) \to (x_0 \to x')$ are commutative
diagrams
$$
\xymatrix{
x & & x' \ar[ll] \\
& x_0 \ar[lu] \ar[ru]
}
$$
in $\mathcal{X}$. (Note the reversal of arrows.)
\end{enumerate}
If $x_0 \to x$ is an object of $\mathcal{F}$ then writing $p(x) = \Spec(A)$
we obtain an object $A$ of $\mathcal{C}_\Lambda$. We often say that
$x_0 \to x$ or $x$ lies over $A$. A morphism of $\mathcal{F}$ between objects
$x_0 \to x$ lying over $A$ and $x_0 \to x'$ lying over $A'$
corresponds to a morphism $x' \to x$ of $\mathcal{X}$, hence a morphism
$p(x' \to x) : \Spec(A') \to \Spec(A)$ which in turn corresponds to a
ring map $A \to A'$. As $\mathcal{X}$ is a category
over the category of schemes over $S$ we see that $A \to A'$ is
$\Lambda$-algebra homomorphism. Thus we obtain a functor
\begin{equation}
\label{equation-predeformation-category}
p : \mathcal{F} = \mathcal{F}_{\mathcal{X}, k, x_0}
\longrightarrow
\mathcal{C}_\Lambda.
\end{equation}
We will use the notation $\mathcal{F}(A)$ to denote the fibre category
over an object $A$ of $\mathcal{C}_\Lambda$. An object of $\mathcal{F}(A)$
is simply a morphism $x_0 \to x$ of $\mathcal{X}$ such that
$x$ lies over $\Spec(A)$ and $x_0 \to x$ lies over $\Spec(k) \to \Spec(A)$.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-predeformation-category}
The functor $p : \mathcal{F} \to \mathcal{C}_\Lambda$ defined above
is a predeformation category.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
We have to show that $\mathcal{F}$ is (a) cofibred in groupoids over
$\mathcal{C}_\Lambda$ and (b) that $\mathcal{F}(k)$ is a category equivalent
to a category with a single object and a single morphism.

\medskip\noindent
Proof of (a). The fibre categories of $\mathcal{F}$
over $\mathcal{C}_\Lambda$ are groupoids as the fibre categories
of $\mathcal{X}$ are groupoids. Let $A \to A'$ be a morphism of
$\mathcal{C}_\Lambda$ and let $x_0 \to x$ be an object of $\mathcal{F}(A)$.
Because $\mathcal{X}$ is fibred in groupoids, we can find a morphism
$x' \to x$ lying over $\Spec(A') \to \Spec(A)$. Since the composition
$A \to A' \to k$ is equal the given map $A \to k$ we see (by uniqueness
of pullbacks up to isomorphism) that the pullback via $\Spec(k) \to \Spec(A')$
of $x'$ is $x_0$, i.e., that there exists a morphism $x_0 \to x'$
lying over $\Spec(k) \to \Spec(A')$ compatible with
$x_0 \to x$ and $x' \to x$. This proves that $\mathcal{F}$ has
pushforwards. We conclude by (the dual of)
Categories, Lemma \ref{categories-lemma-fibred-groupoids}.

\medskip\noindent
Proof of (b). If $A = k$, then $\Spec(k) = \Spec(A)$ and since $\mathcal{X}$
is fibred in groupoids over $(\Sch/S)_{fppf}$ we see that given any object
$x_0 \to x$ in $\mathcal{F}(k)$ the morphism $x_0 \to x$ is an isomorphism.
Hence every object of $\mathcal{F}(k)$ is isomorphic to $x_0 \to x_0$.
Clearly the only self morphism of $x_0 \to x_0$ in $\mathcal{F}$ is
the identity.
\end{proof}






\section{The Deformation Category of a Point of an Algebraic Stack}
\label{section-algebraic-stacks}

\noindent
To do: Show that an algebraic stack of finite type over a locally Noetherian
base satisfies (RS) at any finite type point. This will provide some
motivation for Artin's criteria later.
A perhaps more roundabout  way of showing this (which does give more
information, though) is to show that a groupoid presentation of the stack
gives rise to a presentation of the deformation category at any point.




\section{Examples of deformation problems}
\label{section-examples}

\noindent
List of things that should go here:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Describe the general outline of an example.
\item Deformations of schemes:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The Rim-Schlessinger condition.
\item Computing the tangent space.
\item Computing the infinitesimal deformations.
\item The deformation category of an affine hypersurface.
\end{enumerate}
\item Deformations of representations of abstract groups.
\item Deformations of representations of topological groups
(e.g., profinite ones).
\item Deformations of sheaves (for example fix $X/S$, a finite type point
$s$ of $S$, and a quasi-coherent sheaf $\mathcal{F}_s$ over $X_s$).
\item Deformations of algebraic spaces (very similar to deformations
of schemes; maybe even easier?).
\item Deformations of maps (eg morphisms between schemes; you can fix
both or one of the target and/or source).
\item Add more here.
\end{enumerate}
