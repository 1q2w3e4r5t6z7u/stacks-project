\section{Introduction}
\label{section-introduction}

\noindent
In this chapter we discuss Artin's axioms for the representability of
functors by algebraic spaces. As references we suggest the papers
\cite{ArtinI}, \cite{ArtinII}, \cite{ArtinVersal}.



\section{The Deformation Category of a Point of an Algebraic Stack}
\label{section-algebraic-stacks}

\noindent
To do: Show that an algebraic stack of finite type over a locally Noetherian
base satisfies (RS) at any finite type point. This will provide some
motivation for Artin's criteria later.
A perhaps more roundabout  way of showing this (which does give more
information, though) is to show that a groupoid presentation of the stack
gives rise to a presentation of the deformation category at any point.




\section{Examples of deformation problems}
\label{section-examples}

\noindent
List of things that should go here:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Describe the general outline of an example.
\item Deformations of schemes:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The Rim-Schlessinger condition.
\item Computing the tangent space.
\item Computing the infinitesimal deformations.
\item The deformation category of an affine hypersurface.
\end{enumerate}
\item Deformations of representations of abstract groups.
\item Deformations of representations of topological groups
(e.g., profinite ones).
\item Deformations of sheaves (for example fix $X/S$, a finite type point
$s$ of $S$, and a quasi-coherent sheaf $\mathcal{F}_s$ over $X_s$).
\item Deformations of algebraic spaces (very similar to deformations
of schemes; maybe even easier?).
\item Deformations of maps (eg morphisms between schemes; you can fix
both or one of the target and/or source).
\item Add more here.
\end{enumerate}
