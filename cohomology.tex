\section{Introduction}
\label{section-introduction}

\noindent
In this document we work out some topics on cohomology of sheaves.
We work out what happens for sheaves on sites
as well, allthough we will simply duplicate the discussion,
and have sections detailing the constructions in the topological
case and in the case of sites.
Basic references are \cite{SGA4}, \cite{Godement} and \cite{Iversen}.

\section{Topics}
\label{section-topics}

\noindent
Here are some topics that should be discussed in this chapter.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Definition of cohomology of an abelian sheaf.
\item Definition of cohomology of a sheaf of modules and
how it is the same as the cohomology of the underlying abelian sheaf.
\item Hypercohomology.
\item Ext-groups.
\item Ext sheaves.
\item Tor functors.
\item Higher direct images.
\item Derived pullback.
\item Cup-product.
\item Group cohomology.
\item Comparison of group cohomology and cohomology on $\mathcal{T}_G$.
\item Cech cohomology.
\item Cech to cohomology spectral sequence.
\item Leray Spectral sequence.
\item Etc, etc, etc.
\end{enumerate}
