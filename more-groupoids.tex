\section{Introduction}
\label{section-introduction}

\noindent
This chapter is devoted to advanced topics on groupoid schemes.
See for example the beautiful paper \cite{K-M} by Keel and Mori.

We continue to abide by the conventions and notation introduced in
Groupoids, Section \ref{groupoids-section-notation}.









\section{Some technical lemmas}
\label{section-technical-lemma}

\noindent
Groupoids, Lemma \ref{groupoids-lemma-diagram}
gives us a way to compare the fibres of the map
$s : R \to U$ in a groupoid. We work this out in this section.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-property-invariant}
Let $S$ be a scheme.
Let $(U, R, s, t, c)$ be a groupoid over $S$.
Let $\tau \in \{Zariski,\linebreak[0] fppf, \linebreak[0] etale,\linebreak[0]
smooth,\linebreak[0] syntomic\}$\footnote{The fact that $fpqc$ is missing
is not a typo.}. Let $\mathcal{P}$ be a property of morphisms of schemes
which is $\tau$-local on the target
(Descent, Definition \ref{descent-definition-property-morphisms-local}).
Assume $\{s : R \to U\}$ and $\{t : R \to U\}$ are coverings for the
$\tau$-topology. Let $W \subset U$ be the maximal open subscheme such that
$s^{-1}(W) \to W$ has property $\mathcal{P}$.
Then $W$ is $R$-invariant, see
Groupoids, Definition \ref{groupoids-definition-invariant-open}.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Because $\mathcal{P}$ is $\tau$-local on the base, we see that in particular
$\mathcal{P}$ is Zariski local on the base. Hence $W$ is simply the union
of all Zariski open subschemes of $U$ over which the morphism $s$ has property
$\mathcal{P}$, i.e., the assertion of the lemma makes sense.
Next, consider the diagram in
Groupoids, Lemma \ref{groupoids-lemma-diagram}.
Let $W_1 \subset R$ be the maximal open subscheme over which the morphism
$\text{pr}_1 : R \times_{s, U, t} R \to R$ has property $\mathcal{P}$.
By assumption the morphisms $t$, $s$ are open immersions,
flat of finite presentation, etale, smooth, or syntomic, they are
in particular open, see
Morphisms, Lemma \ref{morphisms-lemma-fppf-open}.
Hence $W' = s(W_1)$ and $W'' = t(W_1)$ are open subschemes of $U$.
Moreover, $\{s|_{W_1} : W_1 \to W'\}$ and $\{t|_{W_1} : W_1 \to W''\}$
are $\tau$-coverings by our assumption that
$\{s : R \to U\}$ and $\{t : R \to U\}$ are $\tau$-coverings, see
Topologies, Definitions
\ref{topologies-definition-zariski-covering},
\ref{topologies-definition-fppf-covering},
\ref{topologies-definition-etale-covering},
\ref{topologies-definition-smooth-covering}, and
\ref{topologies-definition-syntomic-covering}.
Since the two lower squares of the diagram in
Groupoids, Lemma \ref{groupoids-lemma-diagram}
are cartesian we now conclude that
\begin{enumerate}
\item $s : R \to U$ has property $\mathcal{P}$ over $W'$,
\item $t : R \to U$ has property $\mathcal{P}$ over $W''$, and also
\item $\text{pr}_1 : R \times_{s, U, t} R \to R$ has property
$\mathcal{P}$ over $t^{-1}(W)$, and
\item $\text{pr}_1 : R \times_{s, U, t} R \to R$ has property
$\mathcal{P}$ over $s^{-1}(W)$.
\end{enumerate}
Clarification: The first two statements come from descending the property
through the coverings mentioned above, the second two by going up along the
coverings $\{s|_{s^{-1}(W)} : s^{-1}(W) \to W\}$ and
$\{t|_{t^{-1}(W)} : t^{-1}(W) \to W\}$.
All in all we conclude that
$W', W'' \subset W$ and $t^{-1}(W), s^{-1}(W) \subset W_1$. In other words
$W_1 = s^{-1}(W) = t^{-1}(W)$ as desired.
\end{proof}

\noindent
Consider two pairs $(X, x)$, $(S, s)$
where $X$, $S$ are schemes, $x$, $s$ are points.
A {\it morphism of germs} $f : (X, x) \to (S, s)$
is a morphism $f : U \to S$ defined on an open neighbourhood
of $x$ with $f(x) = s$. Two such
$f$, $f'$ are said to give the same morphism of germs
if and only if $f$ and $f'$ agree in some open neighbourhood of $x$.
Let $\tau \in \{Zariski, fpqc, fppf, etale, smooth, syntomic\}$.
We temporarily
introduce the following concept: We say that two morphisms
of germs $f : (X, x) \to (S, s)$ and $f' : (X', x') \to (S', s')$
are {\it isomorphic locally on the base in the $\tau$-topology},
if there exists a pointed scheme $(S'', s'')$ and morphisms of germs
$g : (S'', s'') \to (S, s)$, and $g' : (S'', s'') \to (S', s')$
such that
\begin{enumerate}
\item there exist open neighbourhoods $V$ of $s$
and $V''$ of $s''$ such that $\{g|_{V''} : V'' \to V\}$ is
a $\tau$-covering,
\item there exist open neighbourhoods $V'$ of $s'$
and $V''$ of $s''$ such that $\{g'|_{V''} : V'' \to V'\}$ 
is a $\tau$-covering,
\item there exists an isomorphism
$$
(S'' \times_{g, S, f} X, \tilde x)
\cong
(S'' \times_{g', S', f'} X', \tilde  x')
$$
of germs over the germ $(S'', s'')$ for some choice of points
$\tilde x$ and $\tilde x'$ lying over $(s'', x)$ and $(s'', x')$.
\end{enumerate}
Finally, we simply say that the maps of germs
$f : (X, x) \to (S, s)$ and $f' : (X', x') \to (S', s')$
are {\it flat locally on the base isomorphic} if there exist
$S'', s'', g, g'$ as above but with (1) and (2) simply replaced by
the condition that the local ring maps
$\mathcal{O}_{S, s} \to \mathcal{O}_{S'', s''}$
and $\mathcal{O}_{S', s'} \to \mathcal{O}_{S'', s''}$ are flat.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-two-fibres}
Let $S$ be a scheme.
Let $(U, R, s, t, c)$ be a groupoid over $S$.
Let $r, r' \in R$ with $t(r) = t(r')$ in $U$.
Set $u = s(r)$, $u' = s(r')$.
Denote $F_u = s^{-1}(u)$ and $F_{u'} = s^{-1}(u')$ the scheme
theoretic fibres.
\begin{enumerate}
\item There exists a common field extension
$\kappa(u) \subset k$, $\kappa(u') \subset k$ and
an isomorphism $(F_u)_k \cong (F_{u'})_k$.
\item We may choose the isomorphism above such that a point
lying over $r$ maps to a point lying over $r'$.
\item If the morphisms $s$, $t$ are flat then the morphisms of germs
$s : (R, r) \to (U, u)$ and $s : (R, r') \to (U, u')$ are flat
locally on the base isomorphic.
\item If the morphisms $s$, $t$ are
flat and locally of finite presentation (resp.\ etale, smooth or
syntomic) then the morphisms of germs $s : (R, r) \to (U, u)$
and $s : (R, r') \to (U, u')$ are locally on the base isomorphic
in the fppf (resp.\ etale, smooth, syntomic) topology.
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
We repeatedly use the properties and the existence of the diagram of
Groupoids, Lemma \ref{groupoids-lemma-diagram}.
By the last assertion of that lemma (and
Schemes, Lemma \ref{schemes-lemma-points-fibre-product})
there exists a point $\xi$ of $R \times_{s, U, t} R$
with $\text{pr}_0(\xi) = r$ and $c(\xi) = r'$.
Let $\tilde r = \text{pr}_1(\xi) \in R$.

\medskip\noindent
Proof of (1). Set $k = \kappa(\tilde r)$. Since $t(\tilde r) = u$
and $s(\tilde r) = r'$ we see that $k$ is a common extension
of both $\kappa(u)$ and $\kappa(u')$ and in fact that
both $(F_u)_k$ and $(F_{u'})_k$ are isomorphic to the fibre of
$\text{pr}_1 : R \times_{s, U, t} R \to R$ over $\tilde r$.
Hence (1) is proved.

\medskip\noindent
Part (2) follows since the point $\xi$ maps to $r$, resp.\ $r'$.

\medskip\noindent
Part (3) is clear from the above (using the point $\xi$ for
$\tilde u$ and $\tilde u'$) and the definitions.

\medskip\noindent
If $s$ and $t$ are flat and of finite presentation, then
they are open morphisms (Morphisms, Lemma \ref{morphisms-lemma-fppf-open}).
Hence the image of some affine open neighbourhood $V''$ of $\tilde r$ will
cover an open neighbourhood $V$ of $u$, resp.\ $V'$ of $u'$.
These can be used to show that properties (1) and (2) of the
definition of ``locally on the base isomorphic in the
$\tau$-topology''.
\end{proof}

\noindent
The following lemma means that any groupoid $(U, R, s, t, c)$
with $s, t$ flat and locally of finite presentation is ``equivalent'' to
a groupoid $(U', R', s', t', c')$ such that $s'$ and $t'$ are
Cohen-Macaulay morphisms (and locally of finite presentation). See
More on Morphisms, Section \ref{more-morphisms-section-CM}
for more information on Cohen-Macaulay morphisms.
Here ``equivalent'' can be taken to mean that the quotient stacks
$[U/R]$ and $[U'/R']$ are equivalent stacks, see
Groupoid Spaces, Section \ref{spaces-groupoids-section-stacks}
and Section \ref{spaces-groupoids-section-quotient-stack-restrict}.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-make-CM}
Let $S$ be a scheme.
Let $(U, R, s, t, c)$ be a groupoid over $S$.
Assume $s$ and $t$ are flat and locally of finite presentation.
Then there exists an open $U' \subset U$ such that
\begin{enumerate}
\item $t^{-1}(U') \subset R$ is the largest open subscheme of
$R$ on which the morphism $s$ is Cohen-Macaulay,
\item $s^{-1}(U') \subset R$ is the largest open subscheme of
$R$ on which the morphism $t$ is Cohen-Macaulay,
\item the morphism $t|_{s^{-1}(U')} : s^{-1}(U') \to U$ is
surjective,
\item the morphism $s|_{t^{-1}(U')} : t^{-1}(U') \to U$ is
surjective, and
\item the restriction $R' = s^{-1}(U') \cap t^{-1}(U')$
of $R$ to $U'$ defines a groupoid $(U', R', s', t', c')$ which has the property
that the morphisms $s'$ and $t'$ are Cohen-Macaulay and locally of
finite presentation.
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
We will repeatedly use the results of
Varieties, Lemma \ref{varieties-lemma-CM-base-change}
and
More on Morphisms,
Lemma \ref{more-morphisms-lemma-flat-finite-presentation-CM-open}
without further mention. It implies in particular that for a morphism
$X \to Y$ which is flat and locally of finite presentation the locus
where the morphism is Cohen-Macaulay is an open whose formation commutes
with arbitrary base change, equals the set of points of $X$ where
the local ring of the fibre is Cohen-Macaulay, and is dense in every
fibre of $X \to Y$.
Let $W \subset R$ be the largest open subscheme of $R$ on which the morphism
$s$ is Cohen-Macaulay. Pick $r, r' \in R$ with $u_0 = t(r) = t(r') \in U$.
Set $u = s(r)$, $u' = s(r')$, $F_u = s^{-1}(u)$, and $F_{u'} = s^{-1}(u')$.
By
Lemma \ref{lemma-two-fibres} parts (1) and (2)
and the results referenced above we see that
\begin{align*}
s\text{ Cohen-Macaulay at }r
& \Leftrightarrow
\mathcal{O}_{F_u, r}\text{ Cohen-Macaulay} \\
& \Leftrightarrow
\mathcal{O}_{F_{u'}, r'}\text{ Cohen-Macaulay} \\
& \Leftrightarrow
s\text{ Cohen-Macaulay at }r'
\end{align*}
Hence it follows immediately that $W = t^{-1}(U')$ for some subset
$U' \subset U$. Of course $t(W) = U'$ and since $t$ is open
(Morphisms, Lemma \ref{morphisms-lemma-fppf-open})
we conclude that $U'$ is open. Let $i : R \to R$ be the inverse of the
groupoid. Since $s \circ i = t$ and $t \circ i = s$ we see that $s^{-1}(U')$
is also the largest open of $R$ on which $t$ is Cohen-Macaulay.
This proves (1) and (2).
Part (3) follows as the set of points where $t$ is Cohen-Macaulay
is dense in every fibre. Same argument for (4).
Part (5) is a formal consequence of (1) and (2) and the discussion
of restrictions in
Groupoids, Section \ref{groupoids-section-restrict-groupoid}.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-make-CM-generalize}
Let $S$ be a scheme.
Let $(U, R, s, t, c)$ be a groupoid over $S$.
Assume $s$ and $t$ are flat and locally of finite presentation.
Let $g : U' \to U$ be locally of finite presentation.
Denote $h$ the composition
$$
\xymatrix{
U' \times_{g, U, t} R \ar[r]_-{\text{pr}_1} & R \ar[r]_s & U.
}
$$
Let $\mathcal{P}$ be one of the following properties of morphisms
of schemes: flat, Cohen-Macaulay, syntomic, smooth, etale,
having relative dimension $\leq d$ (add more here as needed).
There exists an open subscheme $U'' \subset U'$ such that
$U'' \times_{g, U, t} R \subset U' \times_{g, U, t} R$ is
the maximal open subscheme on which $h$ is $\mathcal{P}$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Consider the diagram
$$
\xymatrix{
U' \times_{g, U, t} (R \times_{t, U, t} R)
\ar[rr]_-{c \circ (i, 1)}
\ar@<1ex>[d]^-{\text{pr}_1} \ar@<-1ex>[d]_-{\text{pr}_0} & &
R
\ar@<1ex>[d]^-{s} \ar@<-1ex>[d]_-{t}
\\
U' \times_{g, U, t} R \ar[rr]^h & & U
}
$$
This diagram is commutative and both squares are cartesian by
Groupoids, Lemma \ref{groupoids-lemma-diagram-pull}.
We first prove this lemma for
$\mathcal{P}=$``flat''. Let $W \subset U' \times_{g, U, t} R$
be the largest open subscheme on which $h$ is flat. By
More on Morphisms, Lemma \ref{more-morphisms-theorem-openess-flatness}
we see that $W$ exists. By
More on Morphisms, Lemma \ref{more-morphisms-lemma-flat-locus-base-change}
the formation of $W$ commutes with arbitrary base change.
Hence we see that $\text{pr}_0^{-1}(W) = \text{pr}_1^{-1}(W)$ is the largest
opem subscheme on which $c \circ (i, 1)$ is flat. Since the projection
$\pi : U' \times_{g, U, t} R \to U'$ is surjective, flat and locally of finite
presentation as a base change of $t$ we conclude that
$W = \pi^{-1}(U'')$ for some open subscheme $U'' \subset U'$, see
Descent, Lemma \ref{descent-lemma-open-fpqc-covering}.

\medskip\noindent
In the case $\mathcal{P}=$``Cohen-Macaulay'' the same argument works
using
More on Morphisms,
Lemmas \ref{more-morphisms-lemma-base-change-CM} and
\ref{more-morphisms-lemma-flat-finite-presentation-CM-open}.
In the case $\mathcal{P}=$``syntomic'' use
Morphisms, Lemma \ref{morphisms-lemma-set-points-where-fibres-lci}
(the locus is automically open).
In the case $\mathcal{P}=$``smooth'' use
Morphisms, Lemma \ref{morphisms-lemma-set-points-where-fibres-smooth}
(the locus is automically open).
In the case $\mathcal{P}=$``etale'' use
Morphisms, Lemma \ref{morphisms-lemma-set-points-where-fibres-etale}
(the locus is automically open).
In the case $\mathcal{P}=$``relative dimension $\leq d$''
the locus is open by
Morphisms, Lemma \ref{morphisms-lemma-openness-bounded-dimension-fibres}
and formation commutes with base change by
Morphisms, Lemma \ref{morphisms-lemma-dimension-fibre-after-base-change}.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-slice}
Let $S$ be a scheme.
Let $(U, R, s, t, c, e, i)$ be a groupoid scheme over $S$.
Let $G \to U$ be the stabilizer group scheme.
Assume $s$ and $t$ are Cohen-Macaulay and locally of finite presentation.
Let $u \in U$.
Set $r = e(u)$ and $F_u = s^{-1}(u)$. Set
$$
d_1 = \dim(G_u),\quad d_2 = \dim_r(F_u).
$$
If $d_2 > d_1$, then there exist an affine scheme $U'$
and a morphism $g : U' \to U$ such that
\begin{enumerate}
\item $g$ is an immersion and locally of finite presentation,
\item $u \in U'$,
\item the composition
$$
h = s \circ \text{pr}_1 : U' \times_{g, U, t} R \longrightarrow U
$$
is Cohen-Macaulay at $(u, r)$, and
\item letting $R'$ be the restriction of $R$ to $U'$ and setting
$F'_u = (s')^{-1}(u)$ we have $\dim_r(F'_u) = d_2 - 1$.
\end{enumerate}
WARNING: The formulation of this lemma is currently wrong.
If $u$ is a point of finite type over $S$ then it is probably
OK. The error in the proof is that the second displayed equation
is wrong.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Let $\text{Spec}(A) \subset U$ be an affine neighbourhood of $u$.
Let $\text{Spec}(B) \subset R$ be an affine neighbourhood of $r$
which maps via $j$ into the open
$\text{Spec}(A) \times_S \text{Spec}(A) \subset U \times_S U$.
Let $\mathfrak p \subset A$ be the prime ideal corresponding to $u$.
Let $\mathfrak q \subset B$ be the prime ideal corresponding to $r$.
Pictures:
$$
\vcenter{
\xymatrix{
B & A \ar[l]^s \\
A \ar[u]^t
}
}
\quad\text{and}\quad
\vcenter{
\xymatrix{
B_{\mathfrak q} & A_{\mathfrak p} \ar[l]^s \\
A_{\mathfrak p} \ar[u]^t
}
}
$$
Note that $\kappa(\mathfrak p)$ is identified with $\kappa(\mathfrak q)$
via both arrows as $r = e(u)$. The ring maps $s, t : A \to B$ are
locally of finite type and flat. By assumption the ring
$$
\mathcal{O}_{F_u, r} = B_{\mathfrak q}/s(\mathfrak p)B_{\mathfrak q}
$$
is Cohen-Macaulay of dimension $d_2$ (equality of dimension by
Morphisms, Lemma \ref{morphisms-lemma-dimension-fibre-at-a-point}).
By assumption the ring
$$
\mathcal{O}_{G_u, r}
=
B_{\mathfrak q}/(s(\mathfrak p)B_{\mathfrak q} + t(\mathfrak p)B_{\mathfrak q})
$$
has dimension $d_1$ (equality of dimension by
Groupoids, Lemma \ref{groupoids-lemma-group-scheme-finite-type-field}).
We claim this implies we can find
an element $f \in \mathfrak p$ such that
$$
\dim(B_{\mathfrak q}/(s(\mathfrak p)B_{\mathfrak q} + fB_{\mathfrak q}) < d_2
$$
Namely, suppose $\mathfrak n_j \supset s(\mathfrak p)B_{\mathfrak q}$,
$j = 1, \ldots, m$ correspond to the minimal primes of the local ring
$B_{\mathfrak q}/s(\mathfrak p)B_{\mathfrak q}$.
There are finitely many as this ring is Noetherian (since it is essentially
of finite type over a field -- but also because a Cohen-Macaulay ring is
Noetherian). By the Cohen-Macaulay condition we have
$\dim(B_{\mathfrak q}/\mathfrak n_j) = d_2$, for example by
Algebra, Lemma \ref{algebra-lemma-CM-dim-formula}.
Then the conditions $d_1 < d_2$ and
$\dim(B_{\mathfrak q}/(\mathfrak n_j + t(\mathfrak p)B_{\mathfrak q})) = d_1$
implies that
$\mathfrak p \not \subset t^{-1}(\mathfrak n_i)$. Since there are only
finitely many minimal primes in the Noetherian ring
$B_{\mathfrak q}/s(\mathfrak p)B_{\mathfrak q}$ we get our desired $f$
by prime avoidence, see
Algebra, Lemma \ref{algebra-lemma-silly}.

\medskip\noindent
Set $A' = A/fA$ and $U' = \text{Spec}(A')$. Then it is clear that
$U' \to U$ is an immersion, locally of finite presentation
and that $u \in U'$. Moreover, the morphism
$$
U' \times_{g, U, t} R \longrightarrow U
$$
factors through $\text{Spec}(A)$ and corresponds to the ring map
$$
\xymatrix{
B/t(f)B \ar@{=}[r] & A/(f) \otimes_{A, t} B & A \ar[l]_-s
}
$$
Now, we see $t(f)$ is not a zero divisor on
$B_{\mathfrak q}/s(\mathfrak p)B_{\mathfrak q}$ as this is a
Cohen-Macaulay ring of positive dimension and $f$ is not contained
in any minimal prime, see for example
Algebra, Lemma \ref{algebra-lemma-reformulate-CM}.
Hence by
Algebra, Lemma \ref{algebra-lemma-grothendieck-general}
we conclude that $s : A_{\mathfrak p} \to B_{\mathfrak q}/t(f)B_{\mathfrak q}$
is flat with fibre ring
$B_{\mathfrak q}/(s(\mathfrak p)B_{\mathfrak q} + t(f)B_{\mathfrak q})$
which is Cohen-Macaulay of $1$ lower dimension by
Algebra, Lemma \ref{algebra-lemma-reformulate-CM}
again. This implies the final assertion of the lemma and we win.
\end{proof}










\section{Etale localization of groupoids}
\label{section-etale-localize}

\noindent
Lemma \ref{lemma-quasi-finite-over-base-j-proper}
will be used to prove results on algebraic spaces
separated and quasi-finite over a scheme (insert future reference here).

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-quasi-finite-over-base}
Let $S$ be a scheme.
Let $(U, R, s, t, c)$ be a groupoid scheme over $S$.
Let $p \in S$ be a point, and let $u \in U$ be a point lying over $p$.
Assume that
\begin{enumerate}
\item $U \to S$ is locally of finite type,
\item $U \to S$ is quasi-finite at $u$,
\item $U \to S$ is separated,
\item $R \to S$ is separated,
\item $s$, $t$ are flat and locally of finite presentation, and
\item $s^{-1}(\{u\})$ is finite.
\end{enumerate}
Then there exists an etale neighbourhood $(S', p') \to (S, p)$ with
$\kappa(p) = \kappa(p')$ and a base change diagram
$$
\xymatrix{
R' \coprod W'
\ar@{=}[r] &
S' \times_S R
\ar[r] \ar@<2ex>[d]^{s'} \ar@<-2ex>[d]_{t'} &
R \ar@<1ex>[d]^s \ar@<-1ex>[d]_t \\
U' \coprod W
\ar@{=}[r] &
S' \times_S U
\ar[r] \ar[d] &
U \ar[d] \\
 &
S' \ar[r] &
S
}
$$
where the equal signs are decompositions into open and closed
subschemes such that
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(a)] there exists a point $u'$ of $U'$ mapping to $u$ in $U$,
\item[(b)] the fibre $(U')_{p'}$ consists of the points of
$(S' \times_S U)_{p'}$ equivalent to $u'$,
\item[(c)] the fibre $(R')_{p'} = (s')^{-1}(\{u'\})$,
\item[(d)] the schemes $U'$, $R'$ are finite over $S'$,
\item[(e)] we have $s'(R') \subset U'$, $t'(R') \subset U'$,
\item[(f)] we have
$c'(R' \times_{t', U', s'} R') \subset R'$
where $c'$ is the base change of $c$, and
\item[(g)] the morphisms $s', t', c'$ determine a groupoid structure
by taking the system
$(U', R', s'|_{R'}, t'|_{R'}, c'|_{R' \times_{t', U', s'} R'})$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Let us denote $f : U \to S$ the structure morphism of $U$.
Note that $s^{-1}(\{u\}) = \{r_1, \ldots, r_n\}$
is finite implies that $s$ is quasi-finite
at each of these finitely many inverse images, see
Morphisms, Lemma \ref{morphisms-lemma-finite-fibre}.
Hence we see that $f \circ s : R \to S$ is quasi-finite at each $r_i$
(Morphisms, Lemma \ref{morphisms-lemma-composition-quasi-finite}).
Since $t$ is flat and locally of finite presentation,
the morphism of fibres $t_p : R_p \to U_p$ is flat and locally of
finite presentation (Morphisms,
Lemmas \ref{morphisms-lemma-base-change-flat} and
\ref{morphisms-lemma-base-change-finite-presentation}),
hence open (Morphisms,
Lemma \ref{morphisms-lemma-fppf-open}). Thus the fact that $r_i$ is isolated
in $R_p$ implies that $u_i = t(r_i)$ is isolated in $U_p$.
In other words, we see that $f$ is quasi-finite at $u_1, \ldots, u_n$.
Note that $t^{-1}(\{u\}) = \{r_1, \ldots, r_n\}$ and that
$s(\{r_1, \ldots, r_n\}) = \{u_1, \ldots, u_n\}$ since $R$ is a
groupoid. We remark that the cardinality of the set
$\{r_1, \ldots, r_n\}$ is in general greater than the cardinality
of the set $\{u_1, \ldots, u_n\}$. Note that $u \in \{u_1, \ldots, u_n\}$.

\medskip\noindent
We may apply
More on Morphisms,
Lemma \ref{more-morphisms-lemma-etale-splits-off-quasi-finite-part-technical}
to the morphisms
$U \to S$, and $R \to S$ to get an etale neighbourhood
$(S', p') \to (S, p)$ which induces a trivial residue field extension
such that $S' \times_S U$ and $S' \times_S R$ decompose as
$$
S' \times_S U = U' \coprod W, \quad
S' \times_S R = R' \coprod W'
$$
with $U' \to S'$ finite and
$U'_{p'}$ mapping bijectively to $\{u_1, \ldots, u_n\}$, and
$R' \to S'$ finite and
$R'_{p'}$ mapping bijectively to $\{r_1, \ldots, r_n\}$.
Moreover, no point of $W_{p'}$ (resp.\ $W'_{p'}$) maps to
any of the points $u_i$ (resp.\ $r_i$). At this point (a), (b), (c), and (d)
of the lemma are satisfied.

\medskip\noindent
Consider the set $(s'|_{R'})^{-1}(W)$. This is open and closed in $R'$
and does not contain any points of $R'$ lying over $p'$. Since
$R' \to S'$ is closed, we may assume, after shrinking $S'$, that
it is empty. In other words $s'$ maps $R'$ into $U'$.
Similarly, we can arrange it so that $t'$ maps $R'$ into $U'$.
In the same manner, consider the set
$(c'|_{R' \times_{s', U', t'} R'})^{-1}(W')$.
It is open and closed in the scheme $R' \times_{s', U', t'} R'$
which is finite over $S'$, does not contain any points lying
over $p'$, and hence after shrinking $S'$ we may assume
that it is empty. We may repeat the argument also with the identity
$e : U \to R$ and the inverse $i : R \to R$ so that we may assume
(after shrinking $S'$ some more) that $(e'|_{U'})^{-1}(W') = \emptyset$
and $(i'|_{R'})^{-1}(W') = \emptyset$.

\medskip\noindent
At this point we see that we may consider the structure
$$
(U', R', s'|_{R'}, t'|_{R'}, c'|_{R' \times_{t', U', s'} R'},
e'|_{U'}, i'|_{R'}).
$$
The axioms of a groupoid scheme over $S'$ hold
because they hold for the groupoid scheme
$(S' \times_S U, S' \times_S R, s', t', c', e', i')$.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-quasi-finite-over-base-j-proper}
Let $S$ be a scheme.
Let $(U, R, s, t, c)$ be a groupoid scheme over $S$.
Let $p \in S$ be a point, and let $u \in U$ be a point lying over $p$.
Assume assumptions (1) -- (6) of
Lemma \ref{lemma-quasi-finite-over-base}
hold as well as
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(7)] $j : R \to U \times_S U$ is universally closed\footnote{In view of
the other conditions this is equivalent to requiring $j$ to be proper.}.
\end{enumerate}
Then we can choose $(S', p') \to (S, p)$ and decompositions
$S' \times_S U = U' \amalg W$ and $S' \times_S R = R' \amalg W'$
and $u' \in U'$ such that (a) -- (g) of
Lemma \ref{lemma-quasi-finite-over-base}
hold as well as
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(h)] $R'$ is the restriction of $S' \times_S R$ to $U'$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
We apply Lemma \ref{lemma-quasi-finite-over-base} for the
groupoid $(U, R, s, t, c)$ over the scheme $S$ with points $p$ and $u$.
Hence we get an etale neighbourhood
$(S', p') \to (S, p)$ and disjoint union decompositions
$$
S' \times_S U = U' \amalg W, \quad
S' \times_S R = R' \amalg W'
$$
and $u' \in U'$ satisfying conclusions (a), (b), (c), (d), (e), (f), and (g).
We may shrink $S'$ to a smaller neighbourhood of $p'$ without
affecting the conclusions (a) -- (g). We will show that for a suitable
shrinking conclusion (h) holds as well.
Let us denote $j'$ the base change of $j$ to $S'$.
By conclusion (e) it is clear that
$$
j'^{-1}(U' \times_{S'} U') = R' \amalg Rest
$$
for some open and closed $Rest$ piece. Since $U' \to S'$ is finite
by conclusion (d) we see that $U' \times_{S'} U'$ is finite over $S'$.
Since $j$ is universally closed, also $j'$ is universally closed, and
hence $j'|_{Rest}$ is universally closed too. By conclusions
(b) and (c) we see that the fibre of
$$
(U' \times_{S'} U' \to S') \circ j'|_{Rest} :
Rest
\longrightarrow
S'
$$
over $p'$ is empty. Hence, since $Rest \to S'$ is closed as a composition
of closed morphisms, after shrinking $S'$, we may assume that
$Rest = \emptyset$. And this is exactly the condition that $R'$ is
the restriction of $S' \times_S R$ to the open subscheme
$U' \subset S' \times_S U$, see
Groupoids, Lemma \ref{groupoids-lemma-restrict-groupoid-relation}
and its proof.
\end{proof}

\noindent
The following lemma is \cite[Proposition 4.2]{K-M}.
The formulation is minimal in the sense that we only state the assumptions
used in the proof; we know of no applications but the case where
the morphisms $s$, $t$ are also flat (and of finite presentation).
And clearly if $s$, $t$ are flat, then so are $s'$ and $t'$, whence
also $s'|_P$, $t'|_P$.
Note that assumptions (3) and (4) are implied by the assumption
that the fibre of $s$ over $u$ is a finite set, see
Morphisms, Lemma \ref{morphisms-lemma-finite-fibre}.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-quasi-finite-groupoid}
Let $S$ be a scheme.
Let $(U, R, s, t, c)$ be a groupoid scheme over $S$.
Let $u \in U$ be a point. Assume that
\begin{enumerate}
\item $s, t : R \to U$ are separated,
\item $s$, $t$ are locally of finite type, and
\item there are finitely many points $r_1, \ldots, r_n \in R$ with
$s(r_i) = t(r_i) = u$, and
\item $s$ is quasi-finite at each $r_i$.
\end{enumerate}
Then\footnote{The proof of this is currently incomplete and the formulation
of this lemma may have to be changed to assuming $s,t$ are flat and locally
of finite presentation. We are working on it.}
there exists an etale neighbourhood $(U', u') \to (U, u)$
with $\kappa(u) = \kappa(u')$
such that the restriction $R' = R|_{U'}$ of $R$ to $U'$ decomposes
into open and closed subschemes
$$
R' = R|_{U'} = P \coprod W
$$
with
\begin{enumerate}
\item $(U', P, s'|_P, t'|_P, c'|_P)$ is a groupoid scheme over $S$,
\item the morphisms $s'|_P : P \to U'$ and $t'|_P : P \to U'$ are
finite,
\item any point $r' \in R'$ with $s'(r') = t'(r') = u'$ is contained
in $P$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Since $(U, R, s, t, c)$ is a groupoid scheme, we see that also
$t$ is quasi-finite at each $r_i$. By
More on Morphisms,
Lemma \ref{more-morphisms-lemma-etale-splits-off-quasi-finite-part-technical}
we can find an etale neighbourhood $(U', u') \to (U, u)$ with
$\kappa(u) = \kappa(u')$ such that we have disjoint decompositions
$$
R \times_{s, U} U' = V_1 \coprod W_1,
\quad\text{and}\quad
U' \times_{U, t} R = V_2 \coprod W_2
$$
with the following properties
\begin{enumerate}
\item $V_1 \to U'$ is finite,
\item $V_2 \to U'$ is finite,
\item $(V_1)_{u'} = \{r_1, \ldots, r_n\}$ as sets (via the identification
$(R \times_{s, U} U')_{u'} = R_u$),
\item $(V_2)_{u'} = \{r_1, \ldots, r_n\}$ as sets (via the identification
$(U' \times_{U, t} R)_{u'} = R_u$).
\end{enumerate}
By definition of the restriction
(Groupoids, Definition \ref{groupoids-definition-restrict-groupoid})
we have
$$
R|_{U'} = (V_1 \coprod W_1) \times_R (V_1 \coprod W_1).
$$
Hence if we take $P = V_1 \times_R V_2$, then $P$ is open and closed
in the restriction and the morphisms $s'|_P, t'|_P : P \to U'$ are finite.
FIXME: Actually there seems to be no reason for this to hold.

\medskip\noindent
Since $R'$ is a groupoid we have $(s')^{-1}(\{u'\}) = (t')^{-1}(\{u'\})$
and because $\kappa(u) = \kappa(u')$ this set maps bijectively to
$s^{-1}(\{u\}) = t^{-1}(\{u\})$. Hence the set
$\{p' \in P' \mid s'(p') = t'(p') = u'\}$
maps bijectively to $\{r_1, \ldots, r_n\}$.
By our choice of $V_1$ and $V_2$ we see that the subset
$P \cap (s')^{-1}(\{u'\})$ maps bijectively
to $\{r_1, \ldots, r_n\}$. Thus we conclude that (3) holds.

\medskip\noindent
Finally, we have to show that (1) holds, i.e., that
$(U', P, s'|_P, t'|_P, c'|_P)$ is a groupoid.
Consider the morphism $c' : R' \times_{s', U', t'} R' \to R'$.
We want to show that, after possibly shrinking $U'$, that
$c'(P \times_{s'|_P, U', t'|_P} P) \subset P$. To see this
consider $T = (c')^{-1}(W) \cap P \times_{s'|_P, U', t'|_P} P$.
This is an open and closed subscheme of $P \times_{s'|_P, U', t'|_P} P$.
By the discussion in the preceding paragraph we have
$$
(s'|_P)^{-1}(\{u'\}) = \{r_1, \ldots, r_n\} = (t'|_P)^{-1}(\{u'\})
$$
and hence $c'$ maps this set into itself! Hence, if
$p_0, p_1, p_2: R' \times_{t',U',s'} R' \rightarrow U'$ are
the three projections, then $T \cap p_i^{-1}(\{u'\}) = 0$ for $i = 0, 1, 2$.
Since the restrictions of $p_i$ to $P \times_{s'|_P, U', t'|_P} P$ are finite
(because $s'|_P$ and $t'|_P$ are finite), we see that $p_i(T) \subset U'$
is a closed subscheme which does not contain the point $u'$.
Hence we may replace $U'$ by $U' \setminus p_0(T) \cup p_1(T) \cup p_2(T)$
to get to the case where $T = \emptyset$. At this point
we see that $c'(P \times_{s'|_P, U', t'|_P} P) \subset P$
as desired. We omit the verifications that, possibly after shrinking $S'$,
we may assume that also $e'(U') \subset P$ and $i'(P) \subset P$.
Hence we get a groupoid scheme $(U', P, s'|_P, t'|_P, c'|_P, e'|_P, i'|_P)$
and the lemma follows.
