\section{Introduction}
\label{section-introduction}

\noindent
This chapter is devoted to advanced topics on groupoid schemes.
Even though the results are stated in terms of groupoid schemes, the
reader should keep in mind the $2$-cartesian diagram
\begin{equation}
\label{equation-quotient-stack}
\vcenter{
\xymatrix{
R \ar[r] \ar[d] & U \ar[d] \\
U \ar[r] & [U/R]
}
}
\end{equation}
where $[U/R]$ is the quotient stack, see
Groupoids in Spaces, Remark \ref{spaces-groupoids-remark-fundamental-square}.
Many of the results are motivated by thinking about this diagram.
See for example the beautiful paper \cite{K-M} by Keel and Mori.





\section{Notation}
\label{section-notation}

\noindent
We continue to abide by the conventions and notation introduced in
Groupoids, Section \ref{groupoids-section-notation}.






\section{Useful diagrams}
\label{section-diagrams}

\noindent
We briefly restate the results of
Groupoids, Lemmas \ref{groupoids-lemma-diagram} and
\ref{groupoids-lemma-diagram-pull}
for easy reference in this chapter.
Let $S$ be a scheme.
Let $(U, R, s, t, c)$ be a groupoid scheme over $S$.
In the commutative diagram
\begin{equation}
\label{equation-diagram}
\vcenter{
\xymatrix{
& U & \\
R \ar[d]_s \ar[ru]^t &
R \times_{s, U, t} R
\ar[l]^-{\text{pr}_0} \ar[d]^{\text{pr}_1} \ar[r]_-c &
R \ar[d]^s \ar[lu]_t \\
U & R \ar[l]_t \ar[r]^s & U
}
}
\end{equation}
the two lower squares are fibre product squares.
Moreover, the triangle on top (which is really a square)
is also cartesian.

\medskip\noindent
The diagram
\begin{equation}
\label{equation-pull}
\vcenter{
\xymatrix{
R \times_{t, U, t} R
\ar@<1ex>[r]^-{\text{pr}_1} \ar@<-1ex>[r]_-{\text{pr}_0}
\ar[d]_{\text{pr}_0 \times c \circ (i, 1)} &
R \ar[r]^t \ar[d]^{\text{id}_R} &
U \ar[d]^{\text{id}_U} \\
R \times_{s, U, t} R
\ar@<1ex>[r]^-c \ar@<-1ex>[r]_-{\text{pr}_0} \ar[d]_{\text{pr}_1} &
R \ar[r]^t \ar[d]^s &
U \\
R \ar@<1ex>[r]^s \ar@<-1ex>[r]_t &
U
}
}
\end{equation}
is commutative. The two top rows are isomorphic via the vertical maps given.
The two lower left squares are cartesian.










\section{Properties of groupoids}
\label{section-technical-lemma}

\noindent
Let $(U, R, s, t, c)$ be a groupoid scheme.
The idea behind the results in this section is that $s: R \to U$
is a base changes of the morphism $U \to [U/R]$ (see
Diagram (\ref{equation-quotient-stack}).
Hence the local properties of $s : R \to U$ should reflect local
properties of the morphism $U \to [U/R]$.
This doesn't work, because $[U/R]$ is not always an algebraic stack, and
hence we cannot speak of geometric or algebraic properties of
$U \to [U/R]$.
But it turns out that we can make some of it work without even
referring to the quotient stack at all.

\medskip\noindent
Here is a first example of such a result. The open $W \subset U'$ found
in the lemma is roughly speaking the locus where the morphism
$U' \to [U/R]$ has property $\mathcal{P}$.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-local-source}
Let $S$ be a scheme.
Let $(U, R, s, t, c, e, i)$ be a groupoid over $S$.
Let $g : U' \to U$ be a morphism of schemes.
Denote $h$ the composition
$$
\xymatrix{
h : U' \times_{g, U, t} R \ar[r]_-{\text{pr}_1} & R \ar[r]_s & U.
}
$$
Let $\mathcal{P}, \mathcal{Q}, \mathcal{R}$ be properties of morphisms
of schemes. Assume
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\mathcal{R} \Rightarrow \mathcal{Q}$,
\item $\mathcal{Q}$ is preserved under base change and composition,
\item for any morphism $f : X \to Y$ which has $\mathcal{Q}$ there exists a
largest open $W(\mathcal{P}, f) \subset X$ such that $f|_{W(\mathcal{P}, f)}$
has $\mathcal{P}$, and
\item for any morphism $f : X \to Y$ which has $\mathcal{Q}$,
and any morphism $Y' \to Y$ which has $\mathcal{R}$ we have
$Y' \times_Y W(\mathcal{P}, f) = W(\mathcal{P}, f')$, where
$f' : X_{Y'} \to Y'$ is the base change of $f$.
\end{enumerate}
If $s,t$ have $\mathcal{R}$ and $g$ has $\mathcal{Q}$, then
there exists an open subscheme $W \subset U'$ such that
$W \times_{g, U, t} R = W(\mathcal{P}, h)$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Note that the following diagram is commutative
$$
\xymatrix{
U' \times_{g, U, t} R \times_{t, U, t} R
\ar[rr]_-{\text{pr}_{12}}
\ar@<1ex>[d]^-{\text{pr}_{02}} \ar@<-1ex>[d]_-{\text{pr}_{01}} & &
R \times_{t, U, t} R
\ar@<1ex>[d]^-{\text{pr}_1} \ar@<-1ex>[d]_-{\text{pr}_0}
\\
U' \times_{g, U, t} R \ar[rr]^{\text{pr}_1} & & R
}
$$
with both squares cartesian (this uses that the two maps
$t \circ \text{pr}_i : R \times_{t, U, t} R \to U$ are equal).
Combining this with the properties of diagram (\ref{equation-pull})
we get a commutative diagram
$$
\xymatrix{
U' \times_{g, U, t} R \times_{t, U, t} R
\ar[rr]_-{c \circ (i, 1)}
\ar@<1ex>[d]^-{\text{pr}_{02}} \ar@<-1ex>[d]_-{\text{pr}_{01}} & &
R
\ar@<1ex>[d]^-{s} \ar@<-1ex>[d]_-{t}
\\
U' \times_{g, U, t} R \ar[rr]^h & & U
}
$$
where both squares are cartesian.

\medskip\noindent
Assume $s,t$ have $\mathcal{R}$ and $g$ has $\mathcal{Q}$.
Then $h$ has $\mathcal{Q}$ as a composition of $s$ (which has
$\mathcal{R}$ hence $\mathcal{Q}$) and a base change of $g$ (which
has $\mathcal{Q}$). Thus $W(\mathcal{P}, h) \subset U' \times_{g, U, t} R$
exists. By our assumptions we have
$\text{pr}_{01}^{-1}(W(\mathcal{P}, h)) =
\text{pr}_{02}^{-1}(W(\mathcal{P}, h))$
since both are the largest open on which $c \circ (i, 1)$ has $\mathcal{P}$.
Note that the projection $U' \times_{g, U, t} R \to U'$ has a section, namely
$\sigma : U' \to U' \times_{g, U, t} R$, $u' \mapsto (u', e(g(u')))$.
Also via the isomorphism
$$
(U' \times_{g, U, t} R) \times_{U'} (U' \times_{g, U, t} R)
=
U' \times_{g, U, t} R \times_{t, U, t} R
$$
the two projections of the left hand side
to $U' \times_{g, U, t} R$ agree with the morphisms $\text{pr}_{01}$
and $\text{pr}_{02}$ on the right hand side. Since
$\text{pr}_{01}^{-1}(W(\mathcal{P}, h)) =
\text{pr}_{02}^{-1}(W(\mathcal{P}, h))$
we conclude that $W(\mathcal{P}, h)$ is the inverse image of a subset of $U$,
which is necessarily the open set
$W = \sigma^{-1}(W(\mathcal{P}, h))$.
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}
\label{remark-local-source-warning}
Warning:
Lemma \ref{lemma-local-source}
should be used with care.
For example, it applies to $\mathcal{P}=$``flat'', $\mathcal{Q}=$``empty'',
and $\mathcal{R}=$``flat and locally of finite presentation''. But given a
morphism of schemes $f : X \to Y$ the largest open $W \subset X$ such that
$f|_W$ is flat is {\it not} the set of points where $f$ is flat!
\end{remark}

\begin{remark}
\label{remark-local-source-apply}
Notwithstanding the warning in
Remark \ref{remark-local-source-warning}
there are some cases where
Lemma \ref{lemma-local-source}
can be used without causing too much ambiguity.
We give a list. In each case we omit the verification of
assumptions (1) and (2) and we give references which imply
(3) and (4). Here is the list:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\mathcal{Q} = \mathcal{R} =$``locally of finite type'', and
$\mathcal{P} =$``relative dimension $\leq d$''.
See
Morphisms, Definition \ref{morphisms-definition-relative-dimension-d}
and
Morphisms, Lemmas \ref{morphisms-lemma-openness-bounded-dimension-fibres} and
\ref{morphisms-lemma-dimension-fibre-after-base-change}.
\item $\mathcal{Q} = \mathcal{R} =$``locally of finite type'', and
$\mathcal{P} =$``locally quasi-finite''.
This is the case $d = 0$ of the previous item, see
Morphisms, Lemma \ref{morphisms-lemma-locally-quasi-finite-rel-dimension-0}.
\item $\mathcal{Q} = \mathcal{R} =$``locally of finite type'', and
$\mathcal{P} =$``unramified''.
See
Morphisms, Lemmas \ref{morphisms-lemma-unramified-characterize} and
\ref{morphisms-lemma-set-points-where-fibres-unramified}.
\end{enumerate}
What is interesting about the cases listed above is that we do not
need to assume that $s, t$ are flat to get a conclusion about the locus
where the morphism $h$ has property $\mathcal{P}$. We continue the
list:
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(4)] $\mathcal{Q} =$``locally of finite presentation'',
$\mathcal{R} =$``flat and locally of finite presentation'', and
$\mathcal{P} =$``flat''. See
More on Morphisms, Lemmas \ref{more-morphisms-theorem-openess-flatness} and
Lemma \ref{more-morphisms-lemma-flat-locus-base-change}.
\item[(5)] $\mathcal{Q} =$``locally of finite presentation'',
$\mathcal{R} =$``flat and locally of finite presentation'', and
$\mathcal{P}=$``Cohen-Macaulay''. See
More on Morphisms, Definition \ref{more-morphisms-definition-CM}
and
More on Morphisms, Lemmas \ref{more-morphisms-lemma-base-change-CM} and
\ref{more-morphisms-lemma-flat-finite-presentation-CM-open}.
\item[(6)] $\mathcal{Q} =$``locally of finite presentation'',
$\mathcal{R} =$``flat and locally of finite presentation'', and
$\mathcal{P}=$``syntomic'' use
Morphisms, Lemma \ref{morphisms-lemma-set-points-where-fibres-lci}
(the locus is automically open).
\item[(7)] $\mathcal{Q} =$``locally of finite presentation'',
$\mathcal{R} =$``flat and locally of finite presentation'', and
$\mathcal{P}=$``smooth''. See
Morphisms, Lemma \ref{morphisms-lemma-set-points-where-fibres-smooth}
(the locus is automically open).
\item[(8)] $\mathcal{Q} =$``locally of finite presentation'',
$\mathcal{R} =$``flat and locally of finite presentation'', and
$\mathcal{P}=$``etale''. See
Morphisms, Lemma \ref{morphisms-lemma-set-points-where-fibres-etale}
(the locus is automically open).
\end{enumerate}
\end{remark}

\noindent
Here is the second result. The $R$-invariant open $W \subset U$ should be
thought of as the inverse image of the largest open of $[U/R]$ over which
the morphism $U \to [U/R]$ has property $\mathcal{P}$.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-property-invariant}
Let $S$ be a scheme.
Let $(U, R, s, t, c)$ be a groupoid over $S$.
Let $\tau \in \{Zariski,\linebreak[0] fppf, \linebreak[0] etale,\linebreak[0]
smooth,\linebreak[0] syntomic\}$\footnote{The fact that $fpqc$ is missing
is not a typo.}. Let $\mathcal{P}$ be a property of morphisms of schemes
which is $\tau$-local on the target
(Descent, Definition \ref{descent-definition-property-morphisms-local}).
Assume $\{s : R \to U\}$ and $\{t : R \to U\}$ are coverings for the
$\tau$-topology. Let $W \subset U$ be the maximal open subscheme such that
$s|_{s^{-1}(W)} : s^{-1}(W) \to W$ has property $\mathcal{P}$.
Then $W$ is $R$-invariant, see
Groupoids, Definition \ref{groupoids-definition-invariant-open}.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Because $\mathcal{P}$ is $\tau$-local on the base, we see that in particular
$\mathcal{P}$ is Zariski local on the base. Hence $W$ is simply the union
of all Zariski open subschemes of $U$ over which the morphism $s$ has property
$\mathcal{P}$, i.e., the assertion of the lemma makes sense.
Next, consider
diagram (\ref{equation-diagram}).
Let $W_1 \subset R$ be the maximal open subscheme over which the morphism
$\text{pr}_1 : R \times_{s, U, t} R \to R$ has property $\mathcal{P}$.
By assumption the morphisms $t$, $s$ are open immersions
(resp.\ flat of finite presentation, etale, smooth, or syntomic).
In particular $s, t$ are open, see
Morphisms, Lemma \ref{morphisms-lemma-fppf-open}.
Hence $W' = s(W_1)$ and $W'' = t(W_1)$ are open subschemes of $U$.
Moreover, $\{s|_{W_1} : W_1 \to W'\}$ and $\{t|_{W_1} : W_1 \to W''\}$
are $\tau$-coverings by our assumption that
$\{s : R \to U\}$ and $\{t : R \to U\}$ are $\tau$-coverings, see
Topologies, Definitions
\ref{topologies-definition-zariski-covering},
\ref{topologies-definition-fppf-covering},
\ref{topologies-definition-etale-covering},
\ref{topologies-definition-smooth-covering}, and
\ref{topologies-definition-syntomic-covering}.
Since the two lower squares of the
diagram (\ref{equation-diagram})
are cartesian we now conclude that
\begin{enumerate}
\item $s : R \to U$ has property $\mathcal{P}$ over $W'$,
\item $t : R \to U$ has property $\mathcal{P}$ over $W''$, and also
\item $\text{pr}_1 : R \times_{s, U, t} R \to R$ has property
$\mathcal{P}$ over $t^{-1}(W)$, and
\item $\text{pr}_1 : R \times_{s, U, t} R \to R$ has property
$\mathcal{P}$ over $s^{-1}(W)$.
\end{enumerate}
Clarification: The first two statements come from descending the property
through the coverings mentioned above, the second two by going up along the
coverings $\{s|_{s^{-1}(W)} : s^{-1}(W) \to W\}$ and
$\{t|_{t^{-1}(W)} : t^{-1}(W) \to W\}$.
All in all we conclude that
$W', W'' \subset W$ and $t^{-1}(W), s^{-1}(W) \subset W_1$. In other words
$W_1 = s^{-1}(W) = t^{-1}(W)$ as desired.
\end{proof}



\section{Comparing fibres}
\label{section-fibres}

\noindent
Let $(U, R, s, t, c, e, i)$ be a groupoid scheme over $S$.
Diagram (\ref{equation-diagram})
gives us a way to compare the fibres of the map $s : R \to U$ in a groupoid.
For a point $u \in U$ we will denote $F_u = s^{-1}(u)$ the scheme
theoretic fibre of $s : R \to U$ over $u$. For example the diagram
implies that if $u, u' \in U$ are points such
that $s(r) = u$ and $t(r) = u'$, then
$(F_u)_{\kappa(r)} \cong (F_{u'})_{\kappa(r)}$.
This is a special case of the more general and more precise
Lemma \ref{lemma-two-fibres}
below. To see this take $r' = i(r)$.

\medskip\noindent
A pair $(X, x)$ consisting of a scheme $X$ and a point $x \in X$ is sometimes
called the {\it germ of $X$ at $x$}.
A {\it morphism of germs} $f : (X, x) \to (S, s)$
is a morphism $f : U \to S$ defined on an open neighbourhood
of $x$ with $f(x) = s$. Two such
$f$, $f'$ are said to give the same morphism of germs
if and only if $f$ and $f'$ agree in some open neighbourhood of $x$.
Let $\tau \in \{Zariski, etale, smooth, syntomic, fppf\}$.
We temporarily introduce the following concept: We say that two morphisms
of germs $f : (X, x) \to (S, s)$ and $f' : (X', x') \to (S', s')$
are {\it isomorphic locally on the base in the $\tau$-topology},
if there exists a pointed scheme $(S'', s'')$ and morphisms of germs
$g : (S'', s'') \to (S, s)$, and $g' : (S'', s'') \to (S', s')$
such that
\begin{enumerate}
\item $g$ and $g'$ are an open immersion (resp.\ etale, smooth, syntomic,
flat and locally of finite presentation) at $s''$,
\item there exists an isomorphism
$$
(S'' \times_{g, S, f} X, \tilde x)
\cong
(S'' \times_{g', S', f'} X', \tilde  x')
$$
of germs over the germ $(S'', s'')$ for some choice of points
$\tilde x$ and $\tilde x'$ lying over $(s'', x)$ and $(s'', x')$.
\end{enumerate}
Finally, we simply say that the maps of germs
$f : (X, x) \to (S, s)$ and $f' : (X', x') \to (S', s')$
are {\it flat locally on the base isomorphic} if there exist
$S'', s'', g, g'$ as above but with (1) replaced by
the condition that $g$ and $g'$ are flat at $s''$ (this is
much weaker than any of the $\tau$ conditions above
as a flat morphism need not be open).

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-two-fibres}
Let $S$ be a scheme.
Let $(U, R, s, t, c)$ be a groupoid over $S$.
Let $r, r' \in R$ with $t(r) = t(r')$ in $U$.
Set $u = s(r)$, $u' = s(r')$.
Denote $F_u = s^{-1}(u)$ and $F_{u'} = s^{-1}(u')$ the scheme
theoretic fibres.
\begin{enumerate}
\item There exists a common field extension
$\kappa(u) \subset k$, $\kappa(u') \subset k$ and
an isomorphism $(F_u)_k \cong (F_{u'})_k$.
\item We may choose the isomorphism of (1) such that a point
lying over $r$ maps to a point lying over $r'$.
\item If the morphisms $s$, $t$ are flat then the morphisms of germs
$s : (R, r) \to (U, u)$ and $s : (R, r') \to (U, u')$ are flat
locally on the base isomorphic.
\item If the morphisms $s$, $t$ are etale
(resp.\ smooth, syntomic, or flat and locally of finite presentation)
then the morphisms of germs $s : (R, r) \to (U, u)$ and
$s : (R, r') \to (U, u')$ are locally on the base isomorphic
in the etale (resp.\ smooth, syntomic, or fppf) topology.
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
We repeatedly use the properties and the existence of
diagram (\ref{equation-diagram}).
By the properties of the diagram (and
Schemes, Lemma \ref{schemes-lemma-points-fibre-product})
there exists a point $\xi$ of $R \times_{s, U, t} R$
with $\text{pr}_0(\xi) = r$ and $c(\xi) = r'$.
Let $\tilde r = \text{pr}_1(\xi) \in R$.

\medskip\noindent
Proof of (1). Set $k = \kappa(\tilde r)$. Since $t(\tilde r) = u$
and $s(\tilde r) = u'$ we see that $k$ is a common extension
of both $\kappa(u)$ and $\kappa(u')$ and in fact that
both $(F_u)_k$ and $(F_{u'})_k$ are isomorphic to the fibre of
$\text{pr}_1 : R \times_{s, U, t} R \to R$ over $\tilde r$.
Hence (1) is proved.

\medskip\noindent
Part (2) follows since the point $\xi$ maps to $r$, resp.\ $r'$.

\medskip\noindent
Part (3) is clear from the above (using the point $\xi$ for
$\tilde u$ and $\tilde u'$) and the definitions.

\medskip\noindent
If $s$ and $t$ are flat and of finite presentation, then
they are open morphisms (Morphisms, Lemma \ref{morphisms-lemma-fppf-open}).
Hence the image of some affine open neighbourhood $V''$ of $\tilde r$ will
cover an open neighbourhood $V$ of $u$, resp.\ $V'$ of $u'$.
These can be used to show that properties (1) and (2) of the
definition of ``locally on the base isomorphic in the
$\tau$-topology''.
\end{proof}







\section{Cohen-Macaulay presentations}
\label{section-CM}

\noindent
Given any groupoid $(U, R, s, t, c)$ with $s, t$ flat and
locally of finite presentation there exists an ``equivalent''
groupoid $(U', R', s', t', c')$ such that $s'$ and $t'$ are
Cohen-Macaulay morphisms (and locally of finite presentation). See
More on Morphisms, Section \ref{more-morphisms-section-CM}
for more information on Cohen-Macaulay morphisms.
Here ``equivalent'' can be taken to mean that the quotient stacks
$[U/R]$ and $[U'/R']$ are equivalent stacks, see
Groupoid Spaces, Section \ref{spaces-groupoids-section-stacks}
and Section \ref{spaces-groupoids-section-quotient-stack-restrict}.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-make-CM}
Let $S$ be a scheme.
Let $(U, R, s, t, c)$ be a groupoid over $S$.
Assume $s$ and $t$ are flat and locally of finite presentation.
Then there exists an open $U' \subset U$ such that
\begin{enumerate}
\item $t^{-1}(U') \subset R$ is the largest open subscheme of
$R$ on which the morphism $s$ is Cohen-Macaulay,
\item $s^{-1}(U') \subset R$ is the largest open subscheme of
$R$ on which the morphism $t$ is Cohen-Macaulay,
\item the morphism $t|_{s^{-1}(U')} : s^{-1}(U') \to U$ is
surjective,
\item the morphism $s|_{t^{-1}(U')} : t^{-1}(U') \to U$ is
surjective, and
\item the restriction $R' = s^{-1}(U') \cap t^{-1}(U')$
of $R$ to $U'$ defines a groupoid $(U', R', s', t', c')$ which has the property
that the morphisms $s'$ and $t'$ are Cohen-Macaulay and locally of
finite presentation.
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Apply
Lemma \ref{lemma-local-source}
with
$g = \text{id}$ and
$\mathcal{Q} =$``locally of finite presentation'',
$\mathcal{R} =$``flat and locally of finite presentation'', and
$\mathcal{P}=$``Cohen-Macaulay'', see
Remark \ref{remark-local-source-apply}.
This gives us an open $U' \subset U$ such that
Let $t^{-1}(U') \subset R$ is the largest open subscheme of $R$
on which the morphism $s$ is Cohen-Macaulay.
This proves (1).
Let $i : R \to R$ be the inverse of the groupoid.
Since $i$ is an isomorphism, and $s \circ i = t$ and $t \circ i = s$
we see that $s^{-1}(U')$ is also the largest open of $R$ on which $t$ is
Cohen-Macaulay. This proves (2).
By 
More on Morphisms,
Lemma \ref{more-morphisms-lemma-flat-finite-presentation-CM-open}
the open subset $t^{-1}(U')$ is dense in every fibre of $s : R \to U$.
This proves (3). Same argument for (4).
Part (5) is a formal consequence of (1) and (2) and the discussion
of restrictions in
Groupoids, Section \ref{groupoids-section-restrict-groupoid}.
\end{proof}








\section{Properties of groupoids on fields}
\label{section-properties-groupoids-on-fields}

\noindent
A ``groupoid on a field'' indicates a groupoid scheme $(U, R, s, t, c)$
where $U$ is the spectrum of a field. It does {\bf not} mean that
$(U, R, s, t, c)$ is defined over a field, more precisely, it does
{\bf not} mean that the morphisms $s, t : R \to U$ are equal.
Given any field $k$, an abstract group $G$ and a group homomorphism
$\varphi : G \to \text{Aut}(k)$ we obtain a groupoid scheme
$(U, R, s, t, c)$ over $\mathbf{Z}$ by setting
\begin{align*}
U & = \text{Spec}(k) \\
R & = \coprod\nolimits_{g \in G} \text{Spec}(k) \\
s & = \coprod\nolimits_{g \in G} \text{Spec}(\text{id}_k) \\
t & = \coprod\nolimits_{g \in G} \text{Spec}(\varphi(g)) \\
c & = \text{composition in }G
\end{align*}
This example still is a groupoid scheme over $\text{Spec}(k^G)$.
Hence, if $G$ is finite, then $U = \text{Spec}(k)$ is finite over
$\text{Spec}(k^G)$.
In some sense our goal in this section is to show that suitable
finiteness conditions on $s, t$ force any groupoid on a field
to be defined over a finite index subfield $k' \subset k$.

\medskip\noindent
If $k$ is a field and $(G, m)$ is a group scheme over $k$ with structure
morphism $p : G \to \text{Spec}(k)$, then $(\text{Spec}(k), G, p, p, m)$
is an example of a groupoid on a field (and in this case of course the whole
structure is defined over a field). Hence this section can be viewed as the
analogue of
Groupoids, Section \ref{groupoids-section-properties-group-schemes-field}.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-groupoid-on-field-open-multiplication}
Let $S$ be a scheme. Let $(U, R, s, t, c)$ be a groupoid scheme
over $S$. If $U$ is the spectrum of a field, then the composition
morphism $c : R \times_{s, U, t} R \to R$ is open.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
The composition is isomorphic to the projection map
$\text{pr}_1 : R \times_{t, U, t} R \to R$ by
Diagram (\ref{equation-pull}).
The projection is open by
Morphisms, Lemma \ref{morphisms-lemma-scheme-over-field-universally-open}.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-groupoid-on-field-separated}
Let $S$ be a scheme. Let $(U, R, s, t, c)$ be a groupoid scheme
over $S$. If $U$ is the spectrum of a field,
then $R$ is a separated scheme.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
By
Groupoids, Lemma \ref{groupoids-lemma-group-scheme-over-field-separated}
the stabilizer group scheme $G \to U$ is separated. By
Groupoids, Lemma \ref{groupoids-lemma-diagonal}
the morphism $j = (t, s) : R \to U \times_S U$ is separated.
As $U$ is the spectrum of a field the scheme
$U \times_S U$ is affine (by the construction of fibre products in
Schemes, Section \ref{schemes-section-fibre-products}).
Hence $R$ is a separated scheme, see
Schemes, Lemma \ref{schemes-lemma-separated-permanence}.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-groupoid-on-field-homogeneous}
Let $S$ be a scheme. Let $(U, R, s, t, c)$ be a groupoid scheme
over $S$. Assume $U = \text{Spec}(k)$ with $k$ a field.
For any points $r, r' \in R$ there exists a field extension
$k \subset k'$ and points
$r_1, r_2 \in R \times_{s, \text{Spec}(k)} \text{Spec}(k')$
and a diagram
$$
\xymatrix{
R &
R \times_{s, \text{Spec}(k)} \text{Spec}(k')
\ar[l]_-{\text{pr}_0} \ar[r]^\varphi &
R \times_{s, \text{Spec}(k)} \text{Spec}(k')
\ar[r]^-{\text{pr}_0} &
R
}
$$
such that $\varphi$ is an isomorphism of schemes over $\text{Spec}(k')$,
we have $\varphi(r_1) = r_2$, $\text{pr}_0(r_1) = r$, and
$\text{pr}_0(r_2) = r'$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
This is a special case of
Lemma \ref{lemma-two-fibres}
parts (1) and (2).
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-restrict-groupoid-on-field}
Let $S$ be a scheme. Let $(U, R, s, t, c)$ be a groupoid scheme
over $S$. Assume $U = \text{Spec}(k)$ with $k$ a field.
Let $k \subset k'$ be a field extension, $U' = \text{Spec}(k')$
and let $(U', R', s', t', c')$ be the restriction of
$(U, R, s, t, c)$ via $U' \to U$. In the defining diagram
$$
\xymatrix{
R' \ar[d] \ar[r] \ar@/_3pc/[dd]_{t'} \ar@/^1pc/[rr]^{s'} \ar@{..>}[rd] &
R \times_{s, U} U' \ar[r] \ar[d] &
U' \ar[d] \\
U' \times_{U, t} R \ar[d] \ar[r] &
R \ar[r]^s \ar[d]_t &
U \\
U' \ar[r] &
U
}
$$
all the morphisms are surjective and flat. The dotted arrow $R' \to R$ is
affine, surjective and flat.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
The morphism $U' \to U$ equals $\text{Spec}(k') \to \text{Spec}(k)$,
hence is affine, surjective and flat. Since $R$ is not empty and $U$ is the
spectrum of a field the morphisms $s, t : R \to U$ are surjective and flat.
Then you conclude by using
Morphisms, Lemmas \ref{morphisms-lemma-base-change-surjective},
\ref{morphisms-lemma-composition-surjective},
\ref{morphisms-lemma-base-change-affine},
\ref{morphisms-lemma-composition-affine},
\ref{morphisms-lemma-base-change-flat}, and
\ref{morphisms-lemma-composition-flat}.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-groupoid-on-field-explain-points}
Let $S$ be a scheme. Let $(U, R, s, t, c)$ be a groupoid scheme
over $S$. Assume $U = \text{Spec}(k)$ with $k$ a field.
For any point $r \in R$ there exist
\begin{enumerate}
\item a field extension $k \subset k'$ with $k'$ algebraically closed,
\item a point $r' \in R'$ where $(U', R', s', t', c')$ is the
restriction of $(U, R, s, t, c)$ via $\text{Spec}(k') \to \text{Spec}(k)$
\end{enumerate}
such that
\begin{enumerate}
\item the point $r'$ maps to $r$ under the morphism $R' \to R$, and
\item the maps $s', t' : R' \to \text{Spec}(k')$ induce isomorphisms
$k' \to \kappa(r')$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Translating the geometric statement into a statement on fields,
this means that we can find a diagram
$$
\xymatrix{
k' & k' \ar[l]^1 & \\
k' \ar[u]^\tau & \kappa(r) \ar[lu]^\sigma & k \ar[l]^-s \ar[lu]_i \\
& k \ar[lu]^i \ar[u]_t
}
$$
where $i : k \to k'$ is the embedding of $k$ into $k'$,
the maps $s, t : k \to \kappa(r)$ are induced by $s, t : R \to U$, and
the map $\tau : k' \to k'$ is an automorphism. To produce such
a diagram we may proceed in the following way:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Pick $i : k \to k'$ a field map with $k'$ algebraically closed of
very large transcendence degree over $k$.
\item Pick an embedding $\sigma : \kappa(r) \to k'$ such that
$\sigma \circ s = i$. Such a $\sigma$ exists because we can just
choose a transcendence basis $\{x_\alpha\}_{\alpha \in A}$ of $\kappa(r)$
over $k$ and find $y_\alpha \in k'$, $\alpha \in A$ which are algebraically
independent over $i(k)$, and map $s(k)(\{x_\alpha\})$ into $k'$ by
the rules $s(\lambda) \mapsto i(\lambda)$ for $\lambda \in k$
and $x_\alpha \mapsto y_\alpha$ for $\alpha \in A$.
Then extend to $\tau : \kappa(\alpha) \to k'$ using that $k'$ is
algebraically closed.
\item Pick an automorphism $\tau : k' \to k'$ such that
$\tau \circ i = \sigma \circ t$. To do this pick a transcendence
basis $\{x_\alpha\}_{\alpha \in A}$ of $k$ over its prime field.
On the one hand, extend $\{i(x_\alpha)\}$ to a transcedence basis of
$k'$ by adding $\{y_\beta\}_{\beta \in B}$ and extend
$\{\sigma(t(x_\alpha))\}$ to a transcendence basis of $k'$ by adding
$\{z_\gamma\}_{\gamma \in C}$. As $k'$ has large transcendence degree
we see that the sets $B$ and $C$ have the same cardinality.
Hence we can first extend the isomorphism
$\sigma \circ t \circ i^{-1} : i(k) \to \sigma(t(k))$
to an isomorphism $\overline{i(k)} \to \overline{\sigma(t(k))}$
of their algebraic closures in $k'$. Then we can use a bijection
$p : B \to C$ to extend this to an isomorphism
$$
\overline{i(k)}(\{y_\beta\})
\longrightarrow
\overline{\sigma(t(k))}(\{z_\gamma\})
$$
and then since $k'$ is the algebraic closure of both sides we
see that this extends to an automorphism $\tau : k' \to k'$
as desired.
\end{enumerate}
This proves the lemma.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-groupoid-on-field-move-point}
Let $S$ be a scheme. Let $(U, R, s, t, c)$ be a groupoid scheme
over $S$. Assume $U = \text{Spec}(k)$ with $k$ a field.
If $r \in R$ is a point such that $s, t$ induce
isomorphisms $k \to \kappa(r)$, then there is an
automorphism $R \to R$ mapping $e$ to $r$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
This is completely obvious if you think about groupoids in a
functorial way. But we will also spell it out completely.
Denote $a : U \to R$ the morphism with image $r$ such that
$s \circ a = \text{id}_U$ which exists by the hypothesis
that $s : k \to \kappa(r)$ is an isomorphism. Similarly, denote
$b : U \to R$ the morphism with image $r$ such that
$t \circ b = \text{id}_U$. Note that
$b = a \circ (t \circ a)^{-1}$, in particular
$a \circ s \circ b = b$.

\medskip\noindent
Consider the morphism $\Psi : R \to R$ given on $T$-valued points
by
$$
(f : T \to R) \longmapsto (c(a \circ t \circ f, f) : T \to R)
$$
To see this is defined we have to check that
$s \circ a \circ t \circ f = t \circ f$ which is obvious as $s \circ a = 1$.
Note that $\Phi(e) = a$, so that in order to prove the lemma it
suffices to show that $\Phi$ is an automorphism of $R$.
Let $\Phi : R \to R$ be the morphism given on $T$-valued points by
$$
(g : T \to R) \longmapsto (c(i \circ b \circ t \circ g, g) : T \to R).
$$
This is defined because
$s \circ i \circ b \circ t \circ g = t \circ b \circ t \circ g =
t \circ g$. We claim that $\Phi$ and $\Psi$ are inverse to
each other. To see this we compute
\begin{align*}
& c(a \circ t \circ c(i \circ b \circ t \circ g, g),
c(i \circ b \circ t \circ g, g)) \\
& =
c(a \circ t \circ i \circ b \circ t \circ g,
c(i \circ b \circ t \circ g, g)) \\
& =
c(a \circ s \circ b \circ t \circ g,
c(i \circ b \circ t \circ g, g)) \\
& =
c(b \circ t \circ g, c(i \circ b \circ t \circ g, g)) \\
& =
c(c(b \circ t \circ g, i \circ b \circ t \circ g), g)) \\
& =
c(e, g) \\
& = g
\end{align*}
where we have used the relation $a \circ s \circ b = b$ shown above.
In the other direction we have
\begin{align*}
& c(i \circ b \circ t \circ c(a \circ t \circ f, f), c(a \circ t \circ f, f)) \\
& =
c(i \circ b \circ t \circ a \circ t \circ f, c(a \circ t \circ f, f)) \\
& =
c(i \circ a \circ (t \circ a)^{-1} \circ t \circ a \circ t \circ f,
c(a \circ t \circ f, f)) \\
& =
c(i \circ a \circ t \circ f, c(a \circ t \circ f, f)) \\
& =
c(c(i \circ a \circ t \circ f, a \circ t \circ f), f) \\
& =
c(e, f) \\
& = f
\end{align*}
The lemma is proved.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-groupoid-on-field-geometrically-irreducible}
Let $S$ be a scheme. Let $(U, R, s, t, c)$ be a groupoid scheme
over $S$. Assume $U = \text{Spec}(k)$ with $k$ a field.
By abuse of notation denote $e \in R$ the image of the identity
morphism $e : U \to R$. Then
\begin{enumerate}
\item every local ring $\mathcal{O}_{R, r}$ of $R$ has a unique
minimal prime ideal,
\item there is exactly one irreducible component $Z$ of $R$
passing through $e$, and
\item $Z$ is geometrically irreducible over $k$ via either
$s$ or $t$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Let $r \in R$ be a point.
In this proof we will use the correspondence between irreducible components
of $R$ passing through a point $r$ and minimal primes of the local
ring $\mathcal{O}_{R, r}$ without further mention.
Choose $k \subset k'$ and $r' \in R'$ as in
Lemma \ref{lemma-groupoid-on-field-explain-points}.
Note that $\mathcal{O}_{R, r} \to \mathcal{O}_{R', r'}$
is faithfully flat and local, see
Lemma \ref{lemma-restrict-groupoid-on-field}.
Hence the result for $r' \in R'$ implies the result for $r \in R$.
In other words we may assume that $s, t : k \to \kappa(r)$
are isomorphisms. By
Lemma \ref{lemma-groupoid-on-field-move-point}
there exists an automorphism moving $e$ to $r$.
Hence we may assume $r = e$, i.e., part (1) follows from part (2).

\medskip\noindent
We first prove (2) in case $k$ is separably algebraically closed.
Namely, let $X, Y \subset R$ be irreducible components
passing through $e$. Then by
Varieties, Lemma \ref{varieties-lemma-bijection-irreducible-components} and
\ref{varieties-lemma-separably-closed-irreducible}
the scheme $X \times_{s, U, t} Y$ is irreducible as well.
Hence $c(X \times_{s, U, t} Y) \subset R$ is an irreducible subset.
We claim it contains both $X$ and $Y$ (as subsets of $R$).
Namely, let $T$ be the spectrum of a field. If $x : T \to X$ is a $T$-valued
point of $X$, then $c(x, e \circ s \circ x) = x$ and $e \circ s \circ x$
factors through $Y$ as $e \in Y$. Similarly for points of $Y$.
This clearly implies that $X = Y$, i.e., there is a unique irreducible
component of $R$ passing through $e$.

\medskip\noindent
Proof of (2) and (3) in general.
Let $k \subset k'$ be a separable algebraic closure, and
let $(U', R', s', t', c')$ be the restriction of
$(U, R, s, t, c)$ via $\text{Spec}(k') \to \text{Spec}(k)$.
By the previous paragraph there is exactly one irreducible
component $Z'$ of $R'$ passing through $e'$.
Denote $e'' \in R \times_{s, U} U'$ the base change of $e$.
As $R' \to R \times_{s, U} U'$ is faithfully flat, see
Lemma \ref{lemma-restrict-groupoid-on-field},
and $e' \mapsto e''$ we see that there is exactly one
irreducible component $Z''$ of $R \times_{s, k} k'$ passing
through $e''$. This implies, as $R \times_k k' \to R$ is faithfully
flat, that there is exactly one irreducible component $Z$ of $R$
passing through $e$. This proves (2).

\medskip\noindent
To prove (3) let $Z''' \subset R \times_k k'$ be an arbitrary
irreducible component of $Z \times_k k'$. By
Varieties, Lemma \ref{varieties-lemma-orbit-irreducible-components}
we see that $Z''' = \sigma(Z'')$ for some $\sigma \in \text{Gal}(k'/k)$.
Since $\sigma(e'') = e''$ we see that $e'' \in Z'''$ and hence
$Z''' = Z''$. This means that $Z$ is geometrically irreducible
over $\text{Spec}(k)$ via the morphism $s$.
The same argument implies that $Z$ is geometrically irreducible
over $\text{Spec}(k)$ via the morphism $t$.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-groupoid-on-field-locally-finite-type-dimension}
Let $S$ be a scheme. Let $(U, R, s, t, c)$ be a groupoid scheme
over $S$. Assume $U = \text{Spec}(k)$ with $k$ a field.
Assume $s, t$ are locally of finite type.
Then
\begin{enumerate}
\item $R$ is equidimensional,
\item $\dim(R) = \dim_r(R)$ for all $r \in R$,
\item for any $r \in R$ we have
$\text{trdeg}_{s(k)}(\kappa(r)) = \text{trdeg}_{t(k)}(\kappa(r))$, and
\item for any closed point $r \in R$ we have
$\dim(R) = \dim(\mathcal{O}_{R, r})$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Let $r, r' \in R$.
Then $\dim_r(R) = \dim_{r'}(R)$ by
Lemma \ref{lemma-groupoid-on-field-homogeneous}
and
Morphisms of Schemes,
Lemma \ref{morphisms-lemma-dimension-fibre-after-base-change}.
By
Morphisms, Lemma \ref{morphisms-lemma-dimension-fibre-at-a-point}
we have
$$
\dim_r(R) =
\dim(\mathcal{O}_{R, r}) + \text{trdeg}_{s(k)}(\kappa(r)) =
\dim(\mathcal{O}_{R, r}) + \text{trdeg}_{t(k)}(\kappa(r)).
$$
On the other hand, the dimension of $R$ (or any open subset of $R$)
is the supremum of the dimensions of the local rings of of $R$, see
Properties of Schemes, Lemma \ref{properties-lemma-codimension-local-ring}.
Clearly this is maximal for closed points $r$ in which case
$\text{trdeg}_{k}(\kappa(r)) = 0$ (by the Hilbert Nullstellensatz, see
Morphisms, Section \ref{morphisms-section-points-finite-type}).
Hence the lemma follows.
\end{proof}














\section{Slicing groupoids}
\label{section-slicing}

\noindent
The following lemma shows that we may slice a Cohen-Macaulay groupoid scheme
in order to reduce the dimension of the fibres, provided that the
dimension of the stabilizer is small. This is an essential step in
the process of improving a given presentation of a quotient stack.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-slice}
Let $S$ be a scheme.
Let $(U, R, s, t, c, e, i)$ be a groupoid scheme over $S$.
Let $G \to U$ be the stabilizer group scheme.
Assume $s$ and $t$ are Cohen-Macaulay and locally of finite presentation.
Let $u \in U$ be a finite type point of $U$, see
Morphisms, Definition \ref{morphisms-definition-finite-type-point}.
Set $r = e(u) \in R$ and $F_u = s^{-1}(u)$ the scheme theoretic fibre.
Set
$$
d_1 = \dim(G_u),\quad
d_2 = \dim_r(F_u).
$$
If $d_2 > d_1$, then there exist an affine scheme $U'$
and a morphism $g : U' \to U$ such that
\begin{enumerate}
\item $g$ is an immersion and locally of finite presentation,
\item $u \in U'$,
\item the composition
$$
h = s \circ \text{pr}_1 : U' \times_{g, U, t} R \longrightarrow U
$$
is Cohen-Macaulay at $(u, r)$, and
\item letting $R'$ be the restriction of $R$ to $U'$ and setting
$F'_u = (s')^{-1}(u)$ we have $\dim_r(F'_u) = d_2 - 1$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Let $\text{Spec}(A) \subset U$ be an affine neighbourhood of $u$
such that $u$ corresponds to a closed point of $U$, see
Morphisms, Lemma \ref{morphisms-lemma-identify-finite-type-points}.
Let $\text{Spec}(B) \subset R$ be an affine neighbourhood of $r$
which maps via $j$ into the open
$\text{Spec}(A) \times_S \text{Spec}(A) \subset U \times_S U$.
Let $\mathfrak m \subset A$ be the maximal ideal corresponding to $u$.
Let $\mathfrak q \subset B$ be the prime ideal corresponding to $r$.
Pictures:
$$
\vcenter{
\xymatrix{
B & A \ar[l]^s \\
A \ar[u]^t
}
}
\quad\text{and}\quad
\vcenter{
\xymatrix{
B_{\mathfrak q} & A_{\mathfrak m} \ar[l]^s \\
A_{\mathfrak m} \ar[u]^t
}
}
$$
Note that the two induced maps
$s, t : \kappa(\mathfrak m) \to \kappa(\mathfrak q)$
are equal and isomorphisms as $r = e(u)$.
In particular we see that $\mathfrak q$
is a maximal ideal as well. The ring maps $s, t : A \to B$ are
locally of finite type and flat. By assumption the ring
$$
\mathcal{O}_{F_u, r} = B_{\mathfrak q}/s(\mathfrak m)B_{\mathfrak q}
$$
is Cohen-Macaulay of dimension $d_2$ (equality of dimension by
Morphisms, Lemma \ref{morphisms-lemma-dimension-fibre-at-a-point}).

\medskip\noindent
Let us compute $G \cap \text{Spec}(B)$. Since $G = j^{-1}(\Delta_{U/S})$
we see that $G \cap \text{Spec}(B)$ is the scheme theoretic inverse image of
$\Delta_{\text{Spec}(A)/S} \subset \text{Spec}(A) \times_S \text{Spec}(A)$
under the morphism
$j = (t, s) : \text{Spec}(B) \to \text{Spec}(A) \times_S \text{Spec}(A)$.
By general nonsense this is the same thing as the inverse image of
$\Delta_{\text{Spec}(A)/\mathbf{Z}} \subset
\text{Spec}(A) \times_{\mathbf{Z}} \text{Spec}(A)$. Hence we see
that $G \cap \text{Spec}(B)$ is given by the spectrum of the ring
$$
B \otimes_{(t, s), A \otimes_{\mathbf{Z}} A} A =
B/(s(a) - t(a); a \in A)
$$
In particular we have
$$
\mathcal{O}_{G, r} =
B_{\mathfrak q} /(s(a) - t(a); a \in A).
$$
Since we have the relation
$$
s(\frac{a}{u}) - t(\frac{a}{u}) =
\frac{1}{s(u)}(s(a) - t(a)) - \frac{t(a)}{s(u)t(u)}(s(u) - t(u))
$$
in $B_{\mathfrak q}$ given $a/u \in A_{\mathfrak m}$, we see that also
$$
\mathcal{O}_{G, r} =
B_{\mathfrak q}/(s(a) - t(a); a \in A_{\mathfrak m}).
$$
This also means that
$$
\mathcal{O}_{G_u, r} =
B_{\mathfrak q}\Big/s(\mathfrak m)B_{\mathfrak q} +
(s(a) - t(a); a \in A_{\mathfrak m}).
$$
To be continued soon...

\medskip\noindent
By assumption the ring $\mathcal{O}_{G_u, r}$
has dimension $d_1$. Equality of dimension by
Groupoids, Lemma \ref{groupoids-lemma-group-scheme-finite-type-field}.
We claim this implies we can find
an element $f \in \mathfrak m$ such that
$$
\dim(B_{\mathfrak q}/(s(\mathfrak m)B_{\mathfrak q} + fB_{\mathfrak q}) < d_2
$$
Namely, suppose $\mathfrak n_j \supset s(\mathfrak m)B_{\mathfrak q}$,
$j = 1, \ldots, m$ correspond to the minimal primes of the local ring
$B_{\mathfrak q}/s(\mathfrak m)B_{\mathfrak q}$.
There are finitely many as this ring is Noetherian (since it is essentially
of finite type over a field -- but also because a Cohen-Macaulay ring is
Noetherian). By the Cohen-Macaulay condition we have
$\dim(B_{\mathfrak q}/\mathfrak n_j) = d_2$, for example by
Algebra, Lemma \ref{algebra-lemma-CM-dim-formula}.
Then the conditions $d_1 < d_2$ and
$\dim(B_{\mathfrak q}/(\mathfrak n_j + t(\mathfrak m)B_{\mathfrak q})) = d_1$
implies that
$\mathfrak m \not \subset t^{-1}(\mathfrak n_i)$. Since there are only
finitely many minimal primes in the Noetherian ring
$B_{\mathfrak q}/s(\mathfrak m)B_{\mathfrak q}$ we get our desired $f$
by prime avoidence, see
Algebra, Lemma \ref{algebra-lemma-silly}.

\medskip\noindent
Set $A' = A/fA$ and $U' = \text{Spec}(A')$. Then it is clear that
$U' \to U$ is an immersion, locally of finite presentation
and that $u \in U'$. Moreover, the morphism
$$
U' \times_{g, U, t} R \longrightarrow U
$$
factors through $\text{Spec}(A)$ and corresponds to the ring map
$$
\xymatrix{
B/t(f)B \ar@{=}[r] & A/(f) \otimes_{A, t} B & A \ar[l]_-s
}
$$
Now, we see $t(f)$ is not a zero divisor on
$B_{\mathfrak q}/s(\mathfrak m)B_{\mathfrak q}$ as this is a
Cohen-Macaulay ring of positive dimension and $f$ is not contained
in any minimal prime, see for example
Algebra, Lemma \ref{algebra-lemma-reformulate-CM}.
Hence by
Algebra, Lemma \ref{algebra-lemma-grothendieck-general}
we conclude that $s : A_{\mathfrak m} \to B_{\mathfrak q}/t(f)B_{\mathfrak q}$
is flat with fibre ring
$B_{\mathfrak q}/(s(\mathfrak m)B_{\mathfrak q} + t(f)B_{\mathfrak q})$
which is Cohen-Macaulay of $1$ lower dimension by
Algebra, Lemma \ref{algebra-lemma-reformulate-CM}
again. This implies the final assertion of the lemma and we win.
\end{proof}










\section{Etale localization of groupoids}
\label{section-etale-localize}

\noindent
Lemma \ref{lemma-quasi-finite-over-base-j-proper}
will be used to prove results on algebraic spaces
separated and quasi-finite over a scheme (insert future reference here).

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-quasi-finite-over-base}
Let $S$ be a scheme.
Let $(U, R, s, t, c)$ be a groupoid scheme over $S$.
Let $p \in S$ be a point, and let $u \in U$ be a point lying over $p$.
Assume that
\begin{enumerate}
\item $U \to S$ is locally of finite type,
\item $U \to S$ is quasi-finite at $u$,
\item $U \to S$ is separated,
\item $R \to S$ is separated,
\item $s$, $t$ are flat and locally of finite presentation, and
\item $s^{-1}(\{u\})$ is finite.
\end{enumerate}
Then there exists an etale neighbourhood $(S', p') \to (S, p)$ with
$\kappa(p) = \kappa(p')$ and a base change diagram
$$
\xymatrix{
R' \coprod W'
\ar@{=}[r] &
S' \times_S R
\ar[r] \ar@<2ex>[d]^{s'} \ar@<-2ex>[d]_{t'} &
R \ar@<1ex>[d]^s \ar@<-1ex>[d]_t \\
U' \coprod W
\ar@{=}[r] &
S' \times_S U
\ar[r] \ar[d] &
U \ar[d] \\
 &
S' \ar[r] &
S
}
$$
where the equal signs are decompositions into open and closed
subschemes such that
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(a)] there exists a point $u'$ of $U'$ mapping to $u$ in $U$,
\item[(b)] the fibre $(U')_{p'}$ consists of the points of
$(S' \times_S U)_{p'}$ equivalent to $u'$,
\item[(c)] the fibre $(R')_{p'} = (s')^{-1}(\{u'\})$,
\item[(d)] the schemes $U'$, $R'$ are finite over $S'$,
\item[(e)] we have $s'(R') \subset U'$, $t'(R') \subset U'$,
\item[(f)] we have
$c'(R' \times_{t', U', s'} R') \subset R'$
where $c'$ is the base change of $c$, and
\item[(g)] the morphisms $s', t', c'$ determine a groupoid structure
by taking the system
$(U', R', s'|_{R'}, t'|_{R'}, c'|_{R' \times_{t', U', s'} R'})$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Let us denote $f : U \to S$ the structure morphism of $U$.
Note that $s^{-1}(\{u\}) = \{r_1, \ldots, r_n\}$
is finite implies that $s$ is quasi-finite
at each of these finitely many inverse images, see
Morphisms, Lemma \ref{morphisms-lemma-finite-fibre}.
Hence we see that $f \circ s : R \to S$ is quasi-finite at each $r_i$
(Morphisms, Lemma \ref{morphisms-lemma-composition-quasi-finite}).
Since $t$ is flat and locally of finite presentation,
the morphism of fibres $t_p : R_p \to U_p$ is flat and locally of
finite presentation (Morphisms,
Lemmas \ref{morphisms-lemma-base-change-flat} and
\ref{morphisms-lemma-base-change-finite-presentation}),
hence open (Morphisms,
Lemma \ref{morphisms-lemma-fppf-open}). Thus the fact that $r_i$ is isolated
in $R_p$ implies that $u_i = t(r_i)$ is isolated in $U_p$.
In other words, we see that $f$ is quasi-finite at $u_1, \ldots, u_n$.
Note that $t^{-1}(\{u\}) = \{r_1, \ldots, r_n\}$ and that
$s(\{r_1, \ldots, r_n\}) = \{u_1, \ldots, u_n\}$ since $R$ is a
groupoid. We remark that the cardinality of the set
$\{r_1, \ldots, r_n\}$ is in general greater than the cardinality
of the set $\{u_1, \ldots, u_n\}$. Note that $u \in \{u_1, \ldots, u_n\}$.

\medskip\noindent
We may apply
More on Morphisms,
Lemma \ref{more-morphisms-lemma-etale-splits-off-quasi-finite-part-technical}
to the morphisms
$U \to S$, and $R \to S$ to get an etale neighbourhood
$(S', p') \to (S, p)$ which induces a trivial residue field extension
such that $S' \times_S U$ and $S' \times_S R$ decompose as
$$
S' \times_S U = U' \coprod W, \quad
S' \times_S R = R' \coprod W'
$$
with $U' \to S'$ finite and
$U'_{p'}$ mapping bijectively to $\{u_1, \ldots, u_n\}$, and
$R' \to S'$ finite and
$R'_{p'}$ mapping bijectively to $\{r_1, \ldots, r_n\}$.
Moreover, no point of $W_{p'}$ (resp.\ $W'_{p'}$) maps to
any of the points $u_i$ (resp.\ $r_i$). At this point (a), (b), (c), and (d)
of the lemma are satisfied.

\medskip\noindent
Consider the set $(s'|_{R'})^{-1}(W)$. This is open and closed in $R'$
and does not contain any points of $R'$ lying over $p'$. Since
$R' \to S'$ is closed, we may assume, after shrinking $S'$, that
it is empty. In other words $s'$ maps $R'$ into $U'$.
Similarly, we can arrange it so that $t'$ maps $R'$ into $U'$.
In the same manner, consider the set
$(c'|_{R' \times_{s', U', t'} R'})^{-1}(W')$.
It is open and closed in the scheme $R' \times_{s', U', t'} R'$
which is finite over $S'$, does not contain any points lying
over $p'$, and hence after shrinking $S'$ we may assume
that it is empty. We may repeat the argument also with the identity
$e : U \to R$ and the inverse $i : R \to R$ so that we may assume
(after shrinking $S'$ some more) that $(e'|_{U'})^{-1}(W') = \emptyset$
and $(i'|_{R'})^{-1}(W') = \emptyset$.

\medskip\noindent
At this point we see that we may consider the structure
$$
(U', R', s'|_{R'}, t'|_{R'}, c'|_{R' \times_{t', U', s'} R'},
e'|_{U'}, i'|_{R'}).
$$
The axioms of a groupoid scheme over $S'$ hold
because they hold for the groupoid scheme
$(S' \times_S U, S' \times_S R, s', t', c', e', i')$.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-quasi-finite-over-base-j-proper}
Let $S$ be a scheme.
Let $(U, R, s, t, c)$ be a groupoid scheme over $S$.
Let $p \in S$ be a point, and let $u \in U$ be a point lying over $p$.
Assume assumptions (1) -- (6) of
Lemma \ref{lemma-quasi-finite-over-base}
hold as well as
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(7)] $j : R \to U \times_S U$ is universally closed\footnote{In view of
the other conditions this is equivalent to requiring $j$ to be proper.}.
\end{enumerate}
Then we can choose $(S', p') \to (S, p)$ and decompositions
$S' \times_S U = U' \amalg W$ and $S' \times_S R = R' \amalg W'$
and $u' \in U'$ such that (a) -- (g) of
Lemma \ref{lemma-quasi-finite-over-base}
hold as well as
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(h)] $R'$ is the restriction of $S' \times_S R$ to $U'$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
We apply Lemma \ref{lemma-quasi-finite-over-base} for the
groupoid $(U, R, s, t, c)$ over the scheme $S$ with points $p$ and $u$.
Hence we get an etale neighbourhood
$(S', p') \to (S, p)$ and disjoint union decompositions
$$
S' \times_S U = U' \amalg W, \quad
S' \times_S R = R' \amalg W'
$$
and $u' \in U'$ satisfying conclusions (a), (b), (c), (d), (e), (f), and (g).
We may shrink $S'$ to a smaller neighbourhood of $p'$ without
affecting the conclusions (a) -- (g). We will show that for a suitable
shrinking conclusion (h) holds as well.
Let us denote $j'$ the base change of $j$ to $S'$.
By conclusion (e) it is clear that
$$
j'^{-1}(U' \times_{S'} U') = R' \amalg Rest
$$
for some open and closed $Rest$ piece. Since $U' \to S'$ is finite
by conclusion (d) we see that $U' \times_{S'} U'$ is finite over $S'$.
Since $j$ is universally closed, also $j'$ is universally closed, and
hence $j'|_{Rest}$ is universally closed too. By conclusions
(b) and (c) we see that the fibre of
$$
(U' \times_{S'} U' \to S') \circ j'|_{Rest} :
Rest
\longrightarrow
S'
$$
over $p'$ is empty. Hence, since $Rest \to S'$ is closed as a composition
of closed morphisms, after shrinking $S'$, we may assume that
$Rest = \emptyset$. And this is exactly the condition that $R'$ is
the restriction of $S' \times_S R$ to the open subscheme
$U' \subset S' \times_S U$, see
Groupoids, Lemma \ref{groupoids-lemma-restrict-groupoid-relation}
and its proof.
\end{proof}

\noindent
The following lemma is \cite[Proposition 4.2]{K-M}.
The formulation is minimal in the sense that we only state the assumptions
used in the proof; we know of no applications but the case where
the morphisms $s$, $t$ are also flat (and of finite presentation).
And clearly if $s$, $t$ are flat, then so are $s'$ and $t'$, whence
also $s'|_P$, $t'|_P$.
Note that assumptions (3) and (4) are implied by the assumption
that the fibre of $s$ over $u$ is a finite set, see
Morphisms, Lemma \ref{morphisms-lemma-finite-fibre}.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-quasi-finite-groupoid}
Let $S$ be a scheme.
Let $(U, R, s, t, c)$ be a groupoid scheme over $S$.
Let $u \in U$ be a point. Assume that
\begin{enumerate}
\item $s, t : R \to U$ are separated,
\item $s$, $t$ are locally of finite type, and
\item there are finitely many points $r_1, \ldots, r_n \in R$ with
$s(r_i) = t(r_i) = u$, and
\item $s$ is quasi-finite at each $r_i$.
\end{enumerate}
Then\footnote{The proof of this is currently incomplete and the formulation
of this lemma may have to be changed to assuming $s,t$ are flat and locally
of finite presentation. We are working on it.}
there exists an etale neighbourhood $(U', u') \to (U, u)$
with $\kappa(u) = \kappa(u')$
such that the restriction $R' = R|_{U'}$ of $R$ to $U'$ decomposes
into open and closed subschemes
$$
R' = R|_{U'} = P \coprod W
$$
with
\begin{enumerate}
\item $(U', P, s'|_P, t'|_P, c'|_P)$ is a groupoid scheme over $S$,
\item the morphisms $s'|_P : P \to U'$ and $t'|_P : P \to U'$ are
finite,
\item any point $r' \in R'$ with $s'(r') = t'(r') = u'$ is contained
in $P$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Since $(U, R, s, t, c)$ is a groupoid scheme, we see that also
$t$ is quasi-finite at each $r_i$. By
More on Morphisms,
Lemma \ref{more-morphisms-lemma-etale-splits-off-quasi-finite-part-technical}
we can find an etale neighbourhood $(U', u') \to (U, u)$ with
$\kappa(u) = \kappa(u')$ such that we have disjoint decompositions
$$
R \times_{s, U} U' = V_1 \coprod W_1,
\quad\text{and}\quad
U' \times_{U, t} R = V_2 \coprod W_2
$$
with the following properties
\begin{enumerate}
\item $V_1 \to U'$ is finite,
\item $V_2 \to U'$ is finite,
\item $(V_1)_{u'} = \{r_1, \ldots, r_n\}$ as sets (via the identification
$(R \times_{s, U} U')_{u'} = R_u$),
\item $(V_2)_{u'} = \{r_1, \ldots, r_n\}$ as sets (via the identification
$(U' \times_{U, t} R)_{u'} = R_u$).
\end{enumerate}
By definition of the restriction
(Groupoids, Definition \ref{groupoids-definition-restrict-groupoid})
we have
$$
R|_{U'} = (V_1 \coprod W_1) \times_R (V_1 \coprod W_1).
$$
Hence if we take $P = V_1 \times_R V_2$, then $P$ is open and closed
in the restriction and the morphisms $s'|_P, t'|_P : P \to U'$ are finite.
FIXME: Actually there seems to be no reason for this to hold.

\medskip\noindent
Since $R'$ is a groupoid we have $(s')^{-1}(\{u'\}) = (t')^{-1}(\{u'\})$
and because $\kappa(u) = \kappa(u')$ this set maps bijectively to
$s^{-1}(\{u\}) = t^{-1}(\{u\})$. Hence the set
$\{p' \in P' \mid s'(p') = t'(p') = u'\}$
maps bijectively to $\{r_1, \ldots, r_n\}$.
By our choice of $V_1$ and $V_2$ we see that the subset
$P \cap (s')^{-1}(\{u'\})$ maps bijectively
to $\{r_1, \ldots, r_n\}$. Thus we conclude that (3) holds.

\medskip\noindent
Finally, we have to show that (1) holds, i.e., that
$(U', P, s'|_P, t'|_P, c'|_P)$ is a groupoid.
Consider the morphism $c' : R' \times_{s', U', t'} R' \to R'$.
We want to show that, after possibly shrinking $U'$, that
$c'(P \times_{s'|_P, U', t'|_P} P) \subset P$. To see this
consider $T = (c')^{-1}(W) \cap P \times_{s'|_P, U', t'|_P} P$.
This is an open and closed subscheme of $P \times_{s'|_P, U', t'|_P} P$.
By the discussion in the preceding paragraph we have
$$
(s'|_P)^{-1}(\{u'\}) = \{r_1, \ldots, r_n\} = (t'|_P)^{-1}(\{u'\})
$$
and hence $c'$ maps this set into itself! Hence, if
$p_0, p_1, p_2: R' \times_{t',U',s'} R' \rightarrow U'$ are
the three projections, then $T \cap p_i^{-1}(\{u'\}) = 0$ for $i = 0, 1, 2$.
Since the restrictions of $p_i$ to $P \times_{s'|_P, U', t'|_P} P$ are finite
(because $s'|_P$ and $t'|_P$ are finite), we see that $p_i(T) \subset U'$
is a closed subscheme which does not contain the point $u'$.
Hence we may replace $U'$ by $U' \setminus p_0(T) \cup p_1(T) \cup p_2(T)$
to get to the case where $T = \emptyset$. At this point
we see that $c'(P \times_{s'|_P, U', t'|_P} P) \subset P$
as desired. We omit the verifications that, possibly after shrinking $S'$,
we may assume that also $e'(U') \subset P$ and $i'(P) \subset P$.
Hence we get a groupoid scheme $(U', P, s'|_P, t'|_P, c'|_P, e'|_P, i'|_P)$
and the lemma follows.
