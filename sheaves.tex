\section{Introduction}
\label{section-introduction}

\noindent
Basic properties of sheaves on topological spaces
will be explained in this document.
A reference is \cite{Godement}.

\medskip\noindent
This will be superceded by the discussion of sheaves
over sites later in the documents. But perhaps it makes 
sense to briefly define some of the notions here.











\section{Basic notions}
\label{section-sheaves-basic}

\noindent
The following notions are considered basic and will not be defined,
and or proved. This does not mean they are all necessarily easy or 
well known.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Nothing sofar.
\end{enumerate}












\section{Presheaves}
\label{section-presheaves}


\begin{definition}
\label{definition-presheaf}
Let $X$ be a topological space.
\begin{enumerate}
\item A {\it presheaf $\mathcal{F}$ of sets on $X$} is a rule which
assigns to each open $U \subset X$ a set $\mathcal{F}(U)$ and
to each inclusion $V \subset U$ a map
$\rho^U_V : \mathcal{F}(U) \to \mathcal{F}(V)$ such that
whenever $W \subset V \subset U$ we have 
$\rho^U_W = \rho^V_W \circ \rho ^U_V$.
\item A morphism $\varphi : \mathcal{F} \to \mathcal{G}$ 
of presheaves of sets on $X$ is a rule which assigns to each
open $U \subset X$ a map of sets $\varphi : \mathcal{F}(U)
\to \mathcal{G}(U)$ compatible with restriction maps,
i.e., whenever $V \subset U \subset X$ are open the
diagram
$$
\xymatrix{
\mathcal{F}(U) \ar[r]^\varphi \ar[d]^{\rho^U_V} &
\mathcal{G}(U) \ar[d]^{\rho^U_V} \cr
\mathcal{F}(V) \ar[r]^\varphi & \mathcal{G}(V)
}
$$
commutes.
\item The category of presheaves of sets on $X$ will be denoted
$\textit{PSh}(X)$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

\noindent
The elements of the set $\mathcal{F}(U)$ are called
the {\it sections} of $\mathcal{F}$ over $U$.
For every $V \subset U$ the map
$\rho^U_V : \mathcal{F}(U) \to \mathcal{F}(V)$
is called the {\it restricton map}. We will use the
notation $s|_V := \rho^U_V(s)$ if $s\in \mathcal{F}(U)$.
This notation is consistent with the notion of restriction
of functions from topology because if $W \subset V \subset U$
and $s$ is a section of $\mathcal{F}$ over $U$ then
$s|_W = (s|_V)|_W$ by the property of the restriction maps
expressed in the definition above.

\begin{definition}
\label{definition-constant-presheaf}
Let $X$ be a topological space. Let $A$ be a set.
The {\it constant presheaf with value $A$} is the
presheaf that assigns the set $A$ to every open
$U \subset X$, and such that all restriction mappings
are $\text{id}_A$.
\end{definition}

\section{Abelian presheaves, etc}
\label{section-abelian-presheaves}

\noindent
In this section we briefly point out some features of the
category of presheaves that allow one to define presheaves
of abelian groups, rings, etc. Of course it would be better
to discuss this in greater generality, using that limits
and colimits exist in the category of presheaves of sets,
but we leave this to our later discussion of (pre)sheaves
on a general site.

\begin{example}
\label{example-singleton-presheaf}
Let $X$ be a topological space $X$. Consider a rule $\mathcal{F}$ that
associates to every open subset a singleton set. Since every set
has a unique map into a singleton set, there exist unique restriction
maps $\rho^U_V$. The resulting structure is a presheaf of sets.
It is a final object in the category of presheaves of sets, by the
property of singleton sets mentioned above. Hence it is
also unique up to unique isomorphism. We will sometimes write $*$
for this presheaf.
\end{example}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-product-presheaves}
Let $X$ be a topological space. The category of presheaves of sets
on $X$ has products (see
Categories, Definition \ref{categories-definition-product}).
Moreover, the set of
sections of the product $\mathcal{F} \times \mathcal{G}$
over an open $U$ is the product of the sets of sections of
$\mathcal{F}$ and $\mathcal{G}$ over $U$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Namely, suppose $\mathcal{F}$ and $\mathcal{G}$ are
presheaves of sets on the topological space $X$.
Consider the rule $U \mapsto \mathcal{F}(U) \times \mathcal{G}(U)$,
denoted $\mathcal{F}\times \mathcal{G}$. If $V \subset U \subset X$
are open then define the restriction mapping
$$
(\mathcal{F} \times \mathcal{G})(U)
\longrightarrow
(\mathcal{F} \times \mathcal{G})(V)
$$
by mapping $(s, t) \mapsto (s|_V, t|_V)$. Then it is immediately
clear that $\mathcal{F}\times\mathcal{G}$ is a presheaf.
Also, there are projection maps
$p : \mathcal{F}\times\mathcal{G} \to \mathcal{F}$
and 
$q : \mathcal{F}\times\mathcal{G} \to \mathcal{G}$.
We leave it to the reader to show that
for any third presheaf $\mathcal{H}$ we have
$\text{Mor}(\mathcal{H}, \mathcal{F}\times \mathcal{G})
= \text{Mor}(\mathcal{H}, \mathcal{F}) \times
\text{Mor}(\mathcal{H}, \mathcal{G})$.
\end{proof}

\noindent
Recall that if $(A, + : A\times A \to A, - : A \to A, 0\in A)$
is an abelian group, then the zero and the negation maps are
uniquely determined by the addition law. In other words, it
makes sense to say ``let $(A, +)$ be an abelian group''.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-abelian-presheaves}
Let $X$ be a topological space.
Let $\mathcal{F}$ be a presheaf of sets.
Consider the following types of structure on $\mathcal{F}$:
\begin{enumerate}
\item For every open $U$ the structure of an abelian group
on $\mathcal{F}(U)$ such that all restriction maps are
abelian group homomorphisms.
\item A map of presheaves
$+ : \mathcal{F} \times \mathcal{F} \to \mathcal{F}$,
a map of presheaves $- : \mathcal{F} \to \mathcal{F}$
and a map $0 : * \to \mathcal{F}$
(see Example \ref{example-singleton-presheaf})
satisfying all the axioms of $+, -, 0$ in a usual
abelian group.
\item A map of presheaves
$+ : \mathcal{F} \times \mathcal{F} \to \mathcal{F}$,
a map of presheaves $- : \mathcal{F} \to \mathcal{F}$
and a map $0 : * \to \mathcal{F}$
such that for each open $U \subset X$ the quadruple
$(\mathcal{F}(U), +, -, 0)$ is an abelian group,
\item A map of presheaves $+ : \mathcal{F} \times \mathcal{F}
\to \mathcal{F}$ such that for every open $U \subset X$
the map $+ : \mathcal{F}(U) \times \mathcal{F}(U) \to \mathcal{F}(U)$
defines the structure of an abelian group.
\end{enumerate}
There are natural bijections between the collections of
types of data (1) - (4) above.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Omitted.
\end{proof}

\noindent
The lemma says that to give an abelian group object $\mathcal{F}$
in the category of presheaves is the same as giving a presheaf of sets
$\mathcal{F}$ such that all the sets $\mathcal{F}(U)$ are endowed
with the structure of an abelian group and such that all the restriction
mappings are group homomorphisms. For most algebra structures
we will take this approach to (pre)sheaves of such objects, i.e.,
we will define a (pre)sheaf of such objects to be a (pre)sheaf
$\mathcal{F}$ of sets all of whose sets of sections $\mathcal{F}(U)$
are endowed with this structure compatibly with the restriction
mappings.

\begin{definition}
\label{definition-abelian-presheaves}
Let $X$ be a topological space.
\begin{enumerate}
\item A {\it presheaf of abelian groups on $X$} or an
{\it abelian presheaf over $X$}
is a presheaf of sets $\mathcal{F}$ such that for each open
$U \subset X$ the set $\mathcal{F}(U)$ is endowed with
the structure of an abelian group, and such that all restriction
maps $\rho^U_V$ are homomorphisms of abelian groups, see
Lemma \ref{lemma-abelian-presheaves} above.
\item A {\it morphism of abelian presheaves over $X$}
$\varphi : \mathcal{F} \to \mathcal{G}$ is a morphism of presheaves
of sets which induces
a homomorphism of abelian groups $\mathcal{F}(U) \to \mathcal{G}(U)$
for every open $U \subset X$.
\item The category of presheaves of abelian groups on $X$ is denoted
$\textit{PAb}(X)$.
\item {\it Presheaves of (not necessarily abelian) groups, rings, modules
over a fixed ring, vector spaces over a fixed field,} etc and
{\it morphisms between these} are defined similarly (see comments
preceding the definition).
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
\label{remark-presheaves-structure}
This remark intends to clarify the definition
of presheaves of algebraic structures.
Suppose that $\mathcal{C}$ is a category and
that $F : \mathcal{C} \to \textit{Sets}$ is
a faithful functor. Typically $F$ is a ``forgetful''
functor. In analogy with Definition \ref{definition-abelian-presheaves}
above a ``presheaf of objects of $\mathcal{C}$'' could be
defined by the following data:
\begin{enumerate}
\item a presheaf of sets $\mathcal{F}$, and
\item for every open $U \subset X$ a choice
of an object $A(U) \in \text{Ob}(\mathcal{C})$
\end{enumerate}
subject to the following conditions
\begin{enumerate}
\item we have $F(A(U)) = \mathcal{F}(U)$ for all $U \subset X$ open, and
\item for every $V \subset U \subset X$ open we have
$\rho^U_V : F(A(U)) = \mathcal{F}(U) \to F(A(V)) = \mathcal{F}(V)$
is in the image of $F : \text{Mor}_{\mathcal{C}}(A(U), A(V))
\to \text{Map}(\mathcal{F}(U), \mathcal{F}(V))$.
\end{enumerate}
In other words, for every $V \subset U$ open in $X$ 
the restriction mappings $\rho^U_V$ is the image
$F(\alpha^U_V)$ for some unique morphism
$\alpha^U_V : A(U) \to A(V)$ in the category $\mathcal{C}$.
The uniqueness is forced by the condition that $F$ is
faithful; it also implies that
$\alpha^U_W = \alpha^V_W \circ \alpha^U_V$
whenever $W \subset V \subset U$ are open in $X$.
The system $(A(-), \alpha^U_V)$ is a {\it presheaf with
values in $\mathcal{C}$ on $X$}, compare
Sites, Definition \ref{sites-definition-presheaf}.
We recover our presheaf of sets $(\mathcal{F}, \rho_V^U)$
via the rules $\mathcal{F}(U) = F(A(U))$ and
$\rho_V^U = F(\alpha_V^U)$.
\end{remark}

\begin{example}
\label{example-direct-sum-points}
Let $X$ be a topological space. For each $x \in X$ suppose
given an abelian group $M_x$. For $U \subset X$ open
we set
$$
\mathcal{F}(U) = \bigoplus\nolimits_{x \in U} M_x.
$$
We denote a typical element in this abelian group by
$\sum_{i=1}^n m_{x_i}$, where $x_i \in U$ and $m_{x_i} \in M_{x_i}$.
(Of course we may always choose our representation such that
$x_1,\ldots,x_n$ are pairwise distinct.)
We define for $V \subset U \subset X$ open a restriction
mapping $\mathcal{F}(U) \to \mathcal{F}(V)$ by
mapping an element $s = \sum_{i=1}^n m_{x_i}$ 
to the element $s|_V = \sum_{x_i \in V} m_{x_i}$.
We leave it to the reader to verify that this is a 
presheaf of abelian groups.
\end{example}

\noindent
Suppose that $\mathcal{O}$ is a presheaf of rings on $X$.
We would like to define the notion of a presheaf of
$\mathcal{O}$-modules over $X$. In analogy with Definition
\ref{definition-abelian-presheaves} we are tempted to define 
this as a sheaf of sets $\mathcal{F}$ such that for every open
$U \subset X$ the set $\mathcal{F}(U)$ is endowed with the structure
of an $\mathcal{O}(U)$-module compatible with restriction mappings
(of $\mathcal{F}$ and $\mathcal{O}$). However, it is customary
(and equivalent) to define it as in the following definition.

\begin{definition}
\label{definition-presheaf-modules}
Let $X$ be a topological space, and let $\mathcal{O}$ be
a presheaf of rings on $X$. A {\it presheaf of $\mathcal{O}$-modules}
is given by an abelian presheaf $\mathcal{F}$ together with a
map of presheaves
$$
\mathcal{O} \times \mathcal{F} \longrightarrow \mathcal{F}
$$
such that for every open $U \subset X$ the map
$\mathcal{O}(U) \times \mathcal{F}(U) \to \mathcal{F}(U)$ 
defines the structure of an $\mathcal{O}(U)$-module
structure on the abelian group $\mathcal{F}(U)$.
\end{definition}

\section{Sheaves}
\label{section-sheaves}

\noindent
In this section we explain the sheaf condition.

\begin{definition}
\label{definition-sheaf}
Let $X$ be a topological space.
\begin{enumerate}
\item A {\it sheaf $\mathcal{F}$ of sets on $X$} is a presheaf
of sets which satsifies the following additional property: Given
any open covering $U = \bigcup_{i \in I} U_i$ and any collection
of sections $s_i \in \mathcal{F}(U_i)$, $i \in I$ such that
$\forall i,j\in I$
$$
s_i|_{U_i \cap U_j} = s_j|_{U_i \cap U_j}
$$
there exists a unique section $s \in \mathcal{F}(U)$ such that
$s_i = s|_U$ for all $i \in I$.
\item A {\it morphism of sheaves of sets} is simply a
morphism of presheaves of sets.
\item The category of sheaves of sets on $X$ is denoted
$\textit{Sh}(X)$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
There is always a bit of confusion as to whether it is
necessary to say something about the set of sections of
a sheaf over the empty set $\emptyset \subset X$.
Note that the empty set is
covered by the empty open covering, and hence the ``collection
of section $s_i$'' from the definition above actually form
an element of the empty product which is the final object
of the category the sheaf has values in. In other words,
if you read the definition right you automatically deduce
that $\mathcal{F}(\emptyset) = \textit{a final object}$,
which in the case of a sheaf of sets is a singleton.
If you do not like this argument, then you can just require
that $\mathcal{F}(\emptyset) = \{*\}$.
\end{remark}

\begin{example}
\label{example-basic-continuous-maps}
Let $X$, $Y$ be topological spaces.
Consider the rule $\mathcal{F}$ wich associates to
the open $U \subset X$ the set
$$
\mathcal{F}(U) = \{ f : U \to Y \mid f \text{ is continuous}\}
$$
with the obvious restriction mappings. We claim that
$\mathcal{F}$ is a sheaf. To see this suppose that
$U = \bigcup_{i\in I} U_i$ is an open covering, and
$f_i \in \mathcal{F}(U_i)$, $i\in I$ with
$f_i |_{U_i \cap U_j} = f_j|_{U_i \cap U_j}$ for all $i,j \in I$.
In this case define $f : U \to Y$ by setting $f(u)$
equal to the value of $f_i(u)$ for any $i \in I$ such that
$u \in U_i$. This is well defined by assumption. Moreover,
$f : U \to Y$ is a map such that its restriction to $U_i$
agrees with the continuous map $U_i$. Hence clearly $f$ is
continuous!
\end{example}

\begin{example}
\label{example-sheaf-product-pointwise}
Let $X$ be a topological space. Let $(A_x)_{x \in X}$ be 
a family of sets $A_x$ indexed by points $x \in X$. We are
going to construct a sheaf of sets $\Pi$ from this data.
For $U \subset X$ open set
$$
\Pi(U) = \prod\nolimits_{x \in U} A_x.
$$
For $V \subset U \subset X$ open define
a restriction mapping by the following rule: An element
$s = (a_x)_{x\in U} \in \Pi(U)$ restricts
to $s|_V = (a_x)_{x \in V}$. It is obvious that this
defines a presheaf of sets. We claim this is a sheaf.
Namely, let $U = \bigcup U_i$ be an open covering.
Suppose that $s_i \in \Pi(U_i)$ are
such that $s_i$ and $s_j$ agree over $U_i \cap U_j$. Write
$s_i = (a_{i,x})_{x\in U_i}$. The compatibility condition implies that
$a_{i, x} = a_{j, x}$ in the set $A_x$ whenever $x \in U_i \cap U_j$. 
Hence there exists a unique element $s = (a_x)_{x\in U}$
in $\Pi(U) = \prod_{x\in U} A_x$ with the property that
$a_x = a_{i, x}$ whenever $x \in U_i$ for some $i$. Of course this
element $s$ has the property that $s|_{U_i} = s_i$ for all $i$.
\end{example}

\begin{example}
\label{example-direct-sum-points-not-sheaf}
Let $X$ be a topological space.
Suppose for each $x\in X$ we are given an abelian group $M_x$.
Consider the presheaf $\mathcal{F} : U \mapsto \bigoplus_{x \in U} M_x$
defined in Example \ref{example-direct-sum-points}. This
is not a sheaf in general. For example, if $X$ is an infinite set
with the discrete topology, then the sheaf condition 
would imply that $\mathcal{F}(X) = \prod_{x\in X} \mathcal{F}(\{x\})$
but by definition we have $\mathcal{F}(X)
= \bigoplus_{x \in X} M_x = \bigoplus_{x \in X} \mathcal{F}(\{x\})$.
And an infinite direct sum is in general different from an infinite
direct product.

\medskip\noindent
However, if $X$ is a topological space such that every open
of $X$ is quasi-compact, then $\mathcal{F}$ {\it is} a sheaf.
This is left as an exercise to the reader.
\end{example}



\section{Abelian sheaves, etc}
\label{section-abelian-sheaves}

\begin{definition}
\label{definition-abelian-sheaf}
Let $X$ be a topological space.
\begin{enumerate}
\item An {\it abelian sheaf on $X$} or
{\it sheaf of abelian groups on $X$}
is an abelian presheaf on $X$ such that the underlying presheaf of
sets is a sheaf.
\item The category of sheaves of abelian groups
is denoted $\textit{Ab}(X)$.
\item {\it Sheaves of groups, rings, modules
over a fixed ring, vector spaces over a fixed field,} etc
are defined to be presheaves of groups, rings,
modules over a fixed ring, vector spaces over a fixed field, etc
such that the underlying presheaf of sets is a sheaf%
\footnote{This only for those categories of algebraic structures
listed here and listed in Lemma \ref{lemma-list-algebraic-structures}.
See Remark \ref{remark-sheaves-structure}}.
\item Given a sheaf of rings $\mathcal{O}$ over $X$
a {\it sheaf of $\mathcal{O}$-modules} is a presheaf
of $\mathcal{O}$-modules $\mathcal{F}$,
see Definition \ref{definition-presheaf-modules},
such that the underlying presheaf of abelian groups $\mathcal{F}$
is a sheaf.
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
\label{remark-sheaves-structure}
This remark intends to clarify the definition
of sheaves of certain types of structures.
It is a continuation
of Remark \ref{remark-presheaves-structure}.
Suppose that $\mathcal{C}$ is a category and
that $F : \mathcal{C} \to \textit{Sets}$ is
a faithful functor. (A good example to keep in mind
is the case where $\mathcal{C}$ is the category of abelian
groups and $F$ is the forgetful functor.)
In Remark \ref{remark-presheaves-structure} we defined
the notion of a presheaf with values in $\mathcal{C}$ on $X$
as a pair $(A(-), \alpha_V^U)$. It gives rise to
a presheaf of sets $(\mathcal{F}, \rho_V^U)$
via the rules $\mathcal{F}(U) = F(A(U))$ and
$\rho_V^U = F(\alpha_V^U)$.
In this setup, when does Definition \ref{definition-sheaf} give
the ``correct notion'' of sheaf? According to
our later definitions (see Sites, Section \ref{sites-section-sheaves}),
if $\mathcal{C}$ has products, then this should imply that
for every open covering $U = \bigcup_{i \in I} U_i$, the
sequence
$$
\xymatrix{
A(U) \ar[r]
&
\prod\nolimits_{i\in I}
A(U_i)
\ar@<1ex>[r] \ar@<-1ex>[r]
&
\prod\nolimits_{(i_0, i_1) \in I\times I}
A(U_{i_0} \cap U_{i_1})
}
$$
is an equalizer diagram {\it in the category $\mathcal{C}$}.
But in the definition above we only require the
corresponding diagram
$$
\xymatrix{
F(A(U)) \ar[r]
&
\prod\nolimits_{i\in I}
F(A(U_i))
\ar@<1ex>[r] \ar@<-1ex>[r]
&
\prod\nolimits_{(i_0, i_1) \in I\times I}
F(A(U_{i_0} \cap U_{i_1}))
}
$$
sets -- after applying the forgetful functor $F$ -- to
be an equalizer diagram!
A small amount of thought shows the definition above {\it does work} if
the category $\mathcal{C}$ and
the functor $F : \mathcal{C} \to \textit{Sets}$
have the following properties:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\mathcal{C}$ has products and equalizers,
\item the functor $F$ commutes with products,
\item the functor $F$ commutes with equalizers, and
\item the functor $F$ reflects isomorphisms.
\end{enumerate}
The last property means that given a morphism
$f : A \to A'$ in $\mathcal{C}$, then $f$ is
an isomorphism if (and only if) $F(f)$ is.
Note that if $\mathcal{C}$ has products and equalizers,
then it has limits, and conditions (1), (2) and (3) can
be reformulated by saying that $\mathcal{C}$ has
limits and $F$ commutes with them.
Below you will find an example where Definition \ref{definition-sheaf}
does not lead to the correct notion.
\end{remark}

\begin{example}
\label{example-sheaves-topological-spaces}
Consider the category of topological spaces $\textit{Top}$.
There is a natural faithful functor $\textit{Top} \to \textit{Sets}$
which commutes with products and equalizers. But it does
not reflect isomorphisms. And, in fact it turns out that
sheaves of topological spaces should not be defined as
in Definition \ref{definition-sheaf}.
Namely, suppose $X = \mathbf{N}$ with the discrete
topology. Let $A_i$, for $i \in \mathbf{N}$ be a discrete
topological space. For any subset $U \subset \mathbf{N}$
define $\mathcal{F}(U) = \prod_{i\in U} A_i$ with the
discrete topology. Then this is a presheaf of topological
spaces whose underlying presheaf of sets is a sheaf, see
Example \ref{example-sheaf-product-pointwise}.
However, if each $A_i$ has at least two elements, then
this is not a sheaf of topological spaces
according to Sites, Definition \ref{sites-definition-sheaf}.
The reader may check that putting the {\it product topology} on
each $\mathcal{F}(U) = \prod_{i\in U} A_i$ does lead to a sheaf
of topological spaces over $X$ (as in Sites,
Definition \ref{sites-definition-sheaf}).
\end{example}






\section{Stalks}
\label{section-stalks}

\noindent
Let $X$ be a topological space. Let $x \in X$ be a point.
Let $\mathcal{F}$ be a presheaf of sets on $X$.
The {\it stalk of $\mathcal{F}$ at $x$} is the set
$$
\mathcal{F}_x
=
\text{colim}_{x\in U} \mathcal{F}(U)
$$
where the colimit is over the set of opens $U \subset X$
containing $x$ (partially) ordered by inclusion, with
transition maps given by the restriction maps of $\mathcal{F}$.
See Categories, Section \ref{categories-section-posets-limits}
for notation and terminology. In other words
$$
\mathcal{F}_x
=
\{
(U,s)
\mid
x\in U, s\in \mathcal{F}(U)
\}/\sim
$$
with equivalence relation given by $(U,s) \sim (U', s')$
if and only if $s|_{U\cap U'} = s'|_{U\cap U'}$. By abuse of
notation we will often denote $(U, s)$
or even $s$ the corresponding element in $\mathcal{F}_x$.
Also we will say $s = s'$ in $\mathcal{F}_x$ for two local sections
of $\mathcal{F}$ defined in a neighbourhod of $x$ to denote that
they have the same image in $\mathcal{F}_x$.

\medskip\noindent
An obvious consequence of this definition is that
for any open $U \subset X$ there is a canonical map
$$
\mathcal{F}(U) 
\longrightarrow
\prod\nolimits_{x \in U} \mathcal{F}_x
$$
defined by $s \mapsto \prod_{x \in U} (U, s)$. Think about it!

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-sheaf-subset-stalks}
Let $\mathcal{F}$ be a sheaf of sets on the topological space $X$.
For every open $U \subset X$ the map
$$
\mathcal{F}(U) 
\longrightarrow
\prod\nolimits_{x \in U} \mathcal{F}_x
$$
is injective.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Suppose that $s, s' \in \mathcal{F}(U)$ map to the same element
in every stalk $\mathcal{F}_x$ for all $x \in U$. This means that
for every $x \in U$, there exists an open $V^x \subset U$,
$x \in V^x$ such that $s|_{V^x} = s'|_{V^x}$. But then
$U = \bigcup_{x \in U} V^x$ is an open covering. Thus by the
uniqueness in the sheaf condition we see that $s = s'$.
\end{proof}


\noindent
Another observation is that the construction of the stalk
$\mathcal{F}_x$ is functorial in the presheaf $\mathcal{F}$.
In other words, it gives a functor
$$
\textit{PSh}(X) \longrightarrow \textit{Sets},
\ \mathcal{F} \longmapsto \mathcal{F}_x.
$$
This functor is called the {\it stalk functor}.
Namely, if $\varphi : \mathcal{F} \to \mathcal{G}$ is 
a morphism of presheaves, then we define
$\varphi_x : \mathcal{F}_x \to \mathcal{G}_x$
by the rule $(U, s) \mapsto (U, \varphi(s))$.
To see that this works we have to check that
if $(U, s) = (U', s')$ in $\mathcal{F}_x$ then also
$(U, \varphi(s)) = (U', \varphi(s'))$ in $\mathcal{G}_x$.
This is clear since $\varphi$ is compatible with the
restriction mappings.

\begin{example}
\label{example-germs-functions}
Suppose $X = \mathbf{R}^n$ with the Euclidean topology.
Consider the presheaf of $\mathcal{C}^\infty$ functions
on $X$, usually denoted $\mathcal{C}^\infty$ as well.
In other words, $\mathcal{C}^\infty(U)$ is the set
of $\mathcal{C}^\infty$-functions $f : U \to \mathbf{R}$.
As in Example \ref{example-basic-continuous-maps}
it is easy to show that this is a sheaf. In fact it
is a sheaf of $\mathbf{R}$-vector spaces.

\medskip\noindent
Next, let $x \in X = \mathbf{R}^n$ be a point. How do
we think of an element in the stalk $\mathcal{C}^\infty_x$?
Such an element is given by a $\mathcal{C}^\infty$-function 
$f$ whose domain contains $x$. And a pair of such
functions $f$, $g$ determine
the same element of the stalk if they agree in a neighbourhood
of $x$. In other words, an element if $\mathcal{C}^\infty_x$
is the same thing as what is sometimes called
a {\it germ of a $\mathcal{C}^\infty$-function at $x$}.
\end{example}

\begin{example}
\label{example-sheaf-product-pointwise-stalk}
Let $X$ be a topological space. Let $A_x$ be a set for each $x \in X$.
Consider the sheaf $\mathcal{F} : U \mapsto \prod_{x\in U} A_x$ of Example
\ref{example-sheaf-product-pointwise}. We would just like to point
out here that the stalk $\mathcal{F}_x$ of $\mathcal{F}$ at $x$
is in general {\it not} equal to the set $A_x$. Of course there is
a map $\mathcal{F}_x \to A_x$, but that is in general the best you
can say. For example, if each neighbourhood of $x$
has infinitely many points, and each $A_{x'}$ has exactly two elements,
then $\mathcal{F}_x$ has infinitely many elements. (Left to the
reader.) On the other hand, if every neighbourhood of $x$ contains
a point $y$ such that $A_y = \emptyset$, then $\mathcal{F}_x = \emptyset$.
\end{example}



\section{Stalks of abelian presheaves, etc}
\label{section-stalks-abelian-presheaves}

\noindent
We first deal with the case of abelian groups as
a model for the general case.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-stalk-abelian-presheaf}
Let $X$ be a topological space. Let $\mathcal{F}$ be a presheaf
of abelian groups on $X$. There exists a unique structure of an
abelian group on $\mathcal{F}_x$ such that for every
$U \subset X$ open, $x\in U$ the map $\mathcal{F}(U) \to \mathcal{F}_x$
is a group homomorphism. Moreover, 
$$
\mathcal{F}_x
=
\text{colim}_{x\in U} \mathcal{F}(U)
$$
holds in the category of abelian groups.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
We define addition of a pair of elements
$(U, s)$ and $(V, t)$ as the pair $(U \cap V, s|_{U\cap V} +
t|_{U \cap V})$. The rest is easy to check.
\end{proof}

\noindent
What is crucial in the proof above is that the system of
neighbourhoods is directed (compare Categories, Definition
\ref{categories-definition-directed}). Namely, the coproduct
of two abelian groups $A, B$ is the direct sum $A \oplus B$, whereas
the coproduct in the category of sets is the disjoint
union $A \coprod B$, showing that colimits in the category
of abelian groups do not agree with colimits in the
category of sets in general. The proof of the lemma will work
for any type of algebraic structure such that directed
colimits commute with the forgetful functor. Combined
with the material in Remarks \ref{remark-presheaves-structure}
and \ref{remark-sheaves-structure} this leads to the following
definition.

\begin{definition}
\label{definition-algebraic-structure}
A {\it type of algebraic structure} is given by a category $\mathcal{C}$
and a functor $F : \mathcal{C} \to \textit{Sets}$ with the
following properties
\begin{enumerate}
\item $F$ is faithful,
\item $\mathcal{C}$ has limits and $F$ commutes with limits,
\item $\mathcal{C}$ has directed colimits and $F$ commutes with them, and
\item $F$ reflects isomorphisms.
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

\noindent
We make this definition to point out the properties
we will use in a number of arguments below.  But we will
not actually study this notion in any generality, since we
are prohibited from studying ``big'' categories by convention,
except for those listed in
Categories, Remark \ref{categories-remark-big-categories}.
Among those the following have the required properties.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-list-algebraic-structures}
The following categories, endowed with the obvious forgetful
functor, define types of algebraic structures:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The category of abelian groups.
\item The category of groups.
\item The category of rings.
\item The category of $R$-modules for a fixed ring $R$.
\item The category of vector spaces over a fixed field.
\item The category of monoids.
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Omitted.
\end{proof}

\noindent
From now on we will think of a (pre)sheaf of algebraic structures
of the types listed above, either in the way described in
Example \ref{remark-presheaves-structure} above, or
simply as a (pre)sheaf of sets with additional structure.
Here is the prototypical example of a result that
holds for any type of algebraic structure.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-stalk-algebraic-structure}
Let $X$ be a topological space.
Let $\mathcal{F}$ be a presheaf of groups, rings, resp.\ a
presheaf of any type of algebraic structure as listed in
Lemma \ref{lemma-list-algebraic-structures}. Let $x \in X$.
Then the stalk $\mathcal{F}_x$ has a unique structure of
a group, ring, resp.\ the corresponding algebraic structure
such that all the morphisms $\mathcal{F}(U) \to \mathcal{F}_x$
are homomorphisms. Moreover,
$$
\mathcal{F}_x = \text{colim}_{x \in U} \mathcal{F}(U)
$$
holds in the category of groups, rings, resp.\ the category
of algebraic structures of the corresponding type.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
First, simply define $\mathcal{F}_x$ by the colimit in
the category of algebraic structures.
Second, verify that the underlying set of this
colimit is the colimit in the category of sets. Both steps
are okay by condition (3) of
Definition \ref{definition-algebraic-structure}.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-stalk-module}
Let $X$ be a topological space.
Let $\mathcal{O}$ be a presheaf of rings on $X$
Let $\mathcal{F}$ be a presheaf $\mathcal{O}$-modules.
Let $x \in X$.
The canonical map $\mathcal{O}_x \times \mathcal{F}_x
\to \mathcal{F}_x$ coming from the multiplication map
$\mathcal{O}\times\mathcal{F} \to \mathcal{F}$ defines
a $\mathcal{O}_x$-module structure on the abelian group
$\mathcal{F}_x$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Omitted.
\end{proof}

\begin{example}
\label{example-sheaf-product-pointwise-algebraic-structure}
Let $F : \mathcal{C} \to \textit{Sets}$ be one
of the types of algebraic structures listed in
Lemma \ref{lemma-list-algebraic-structures}.
Let $X$ be a topological space. Suppose that
for every $x \in X$ we are given an object
$A_x \in \text{ob}(\mathcal{C})$. Consider the presheaf
$\Pi$ with values in $\mathcal{C}$ on $X$ defined by the rule
$\Pi(U) = \prod_{x \in U} A_x$ (with obvious restriction
mappings). Note that the associated presheaf of sets
$U \mapsto F(\Pi(U)) = \prod_{x \in U} F(A_x)$ is a sheaf
by Example \ref{example-sheaf-product-pointwise}.
Hence $\Pi$ is a sheaf of algebraic structures
of type $(\mathcal{C} , F)$. This gives many examples
of sheaves of abelian groups, groups, rings, etc.
\end{example}













\section{Exactness and points}
\label{section-exactness-points}

\noindent
In any category we have the notion of epimorphism, monomorphism,
isomorphism, etc.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-points-exactness}
Let $X$ be a topological space. Let $\varphi : \mathcal{F} \to \mathcal{G}$
be a morphism of sheaves of sets on $X$.
\begin{enumerate}
\item The map $\varphi$ is a monomorphism in the category of sheaves
if and only if for all $x \in X$ the map
$\varphi_x : \mathcal{F}_x \to \mathcal{G}_x$
is injective.
\item The map $\varphi$ is an epimorphism in the category of sheaves
if and only if for all $x \in X$ the map
$\varphi_x : \mathcal{F}_x \to \mathcal{G}_x$
is surjective.
\item The map $\varphi$ is a isomorphism in the category of sheaves
if and only if for all $x \in X$ the map
$\varphi_x : \mathcal{F}_x \to \mathcal{G}_x$
is bijective.
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Fixme.
\end{proof}




\noindent
Here we need to talk about short exact sequences of abelian sheaves, etc.




\section{Sheafification}
\label{section-sheafification}

\noindent
In this section we explain how to get the sheafification
of a presheaf on a topological space. We will use stalks
to describe the sheafification in this case. This is different
from the general procedure described in Sites, Section
\ref{sites-section-sheafification}, and perhaps somewhat
easier to understand.

\medskip\noindent
The basic construction is the following. Let $\mathcal{F}$ be a presheaf
of sets $\mathcal{F}$ on a topological space $X$.
For every open $U \subset X$ we define
$$
\mathcal{F}^{\#}(U)
=
\{
(s_u) \in \prod\nolimits_{u \in U} \mathcal{F}_u
\text{ such that }(*)
\}
$$
where $(*)$ is the property:
\begin{list}{$(*)$}{}
\item For every $u \in U$, there exists an open neighbourhood
$u \in V \subset U$, and a section $\sigma \in \mathcal{F}(V)$
such that for all $v \in V$ we have $s_v = (V, \sigma)$
in $\mathcal{F}_v$.
\end{list}
Note that $(*)$ is a condition for each $u \in U$,
and that given $u \in U$ the truth of this condition
depends only on the values $s_v$ for $v$ in any neighbourhood
of $u$. Thus it is clear that,
if $V \subset U \subset X$ are open, the projection maps
$$
\prod\nolimits_{u \in U} \mathcal{F}_u
\longrightarrow
\prod\nolimits_{v \in V} \mathcal{F}_v
$$
maps elements of $\mathcal{F}^{\#}(U)$ into $\mathcal{F}^{\#}(V)$.
In other words, we get the structure of a presheaf of sets
on $\mathcal{F}^{\#}$. 

\medskip\noindent
Furthermore, the map $\mathcal{F}(U) \to \prod_{u \in U} \mathcal{F}_u$
described in Section \ref{section-stalks} clearly has image
in $\mathcal{F}^{\#}(U)$. In addition, if $V \subset U \subset X$ are
open then we have the following commutative diagram
$$
\xymatrix{
\mathcal{F}(U) \ar[r] \ar[d] &
\mathcal{F}^{\#}(U) \ar[r] \ar[d] &
\prod_{u\in U} \mathcal{F}_u \ar[d]\cr
\mathcal{F}(V) \ar[r] &
\mathcal{F}^{\#}(V) \ar[r] &
\prod_{v\in V} \mathcal{F}_v
}
$$
where the vertical maps are induced from the
restriction mappings. Thus we see that
there is a canonical morphism of presheaves
$\mathcal{F} \to \mathcal{F}^{\#}$.

\medskip\noindent
In Example \ref{example-sheaf-product-pointwise} we saw
that the rule $\Pi(\mathcal{F}) : U \mapsto \prod_{u\in U} \mathcal{F}_u$
is a sheaf, with obvious restriction mappings. And by construction
$\mathcal{F}^{\#}$ is a sub-presheaf of this. In other words, we
have morphisms of presheaves
$$
\mathcal{F} \to \mathcal{F}^\# \to \Pi(\mathcal{F}).
$$
In addition the rule that associates to $\mathcal{F}$
the sequence above is clearly functorial in the presheaf $\mathcal{F}$.
This notation will be
used in the proofs of the lemmas below.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-sheafification-sheaf}
The presheaf $\mathcal{F}^{\#}$ is a sheaf.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
It is probably better for the reader to find their own explanation
of this than to read the proof here. In fact the lemma is true
for the same reason as why the presheaf of continuous
function is a sheaf, see Example \ref{example-basic-continuous-maps}
(and this analogy can be made precise using the espace etale).

\medskip\noindent
Anyway, let $U = \bigcup U_i$ be an open covering.
Suppose that $s_i = (s_{i,u})_{u \in U_i} \in \mathcal{F}^{\#}(U_i)$
such that $s_i$ and $s_j$ agree over $U_i \cap U_j$.
Because $\Pi(\mathcal{F})$ is a sheaf,
we find an element $s = (s_u)_{u\in U}$ in $\prod_{u\in U} \mathcal{F}_u$
restricting to $s_i$ on $U_i$. We have to check property $(*)$.
Pick $u \in U$. Then $u \in U_i$ for some $i$. Hence by $(*)$ for $s_i$,
there exists a $V$ open, $u \in V \subset U_i$
and a $\sigma \in \mathcal{F}(V)$
such that $s_{i, v} = (V, \sigma)$ in $\mathcal{F}_v$ 
for all $v \in V$. Since $s_{i,v} = s_v$ we get $(*)$ for $s$.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-stalk-sheafification}
Let $X$ be a topological space.
Let $\mathcal{F}$ be a presheaf of sets on $X$.
Let $x \in X$. Then $\mathcal{F}_x = \mathcal{F}^\#_x$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
The map $\mathcal{F}_x \to \mathcal{F}^\#_x$
is injective, since already the map
$\mathcal{F}_x \to \Pi(\mathcal{F})_x$ is injective.
Namely, there is a canonical map $\Pi(\mathcal{F})_x \to \mathcal{F}_x$
which is a left inverse to the map $\mathcal{F}_x \to \Pi(\mathcal{F})_x$,
see Example \ref{example-sheaf-product-pointwise-stalk}.
To show that it is surjective, suppose that
$\overline{s} \in \mathcal{F}^\#_x$.
We can find an open neighbourhood $U$ of $x$ such that
$\overline{s}$ is the equivalence class of $(U, s)$
with $s \in \mathcal{F}^\#_x$.
By definition, this means there exists an open neighbourhood
$V$, $x \in V \subset U$ and a section $\sigma \in \mathcal{F}(V)$
such that $s|_V$ is the image of $\sigma$ in $\Pi(\mathcal{F})(V)$.
Clearly the class of $(V, \sigma)$ defines an element of
$\mathcal{F}_x$ mapping to $\overline{s}$.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-sheafifiy-universal}
Let $\mathcal{F}$ be a presheaf of sets on $X$.
Any map $\mathcal{F} \to \mathcal{G}$ into a sheaf of sets 
factors uniquely as
$\mathcal{F} \to \mathcal{F}^\# \to \mathcal{G}$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Clearly, there is a commutative diagram
$$
\xymatrix{
\mathcal{F} \ar[r] \ar[d] &
\mathcal{F}^\# \ar[r] \ar[d] &
\Pi(\mathcal{F}) \ar[d] \\
\mathcal{G} \ar[r] &
\mathcal{G}^\# \ar[r] &
\Pi(\mathcal{G}) \\
}
$$
So it suffices to prove that $\mathcal{G} = \mathcal{G}^\#$.
To see this it suffices to prove, for every point $x \in X$ the
map $\mathcal{G}_x \to \mathcal{G}^\#_x$ is bijective, by
Lemma \ref{lemma-points-exactness}. And this is Lemma
\ref{lemma-stalk-sheafification} above.
\end{proof}

\noindent
This lemma really says that there is an adjoint pair
of functors: $i : \textit{Sh}(X) \to \textit{PSh}(X)$
(inclusion) and $\# : \textit{PSh}(X) \to \textit{Sh}(X)$
(sheafification). The formula is that
$$
\text{Mor}_{\textit{PSh}(X)}(\mathcal{F}, i(\mathcal{G}))
=
\text{Mor}_{\textit{Sh}(X)}(\mathcal{F}^\#, \mathcal{G})
$$
which says that sheafification is a left adjoint of
the inclusion functor. See Categories, Section
\ref{categories-section-adjoint}.




\section{Sheafification of abelian sheaves, etc}
\label{section-sheafify-abelian-presheaves}

\noindent
As usual we first explain how this works for abelian
presheaves.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-diagram-fibre-product}
Let $X$ be a topological space. Let $\mathcal{F}$ be
a presheaf of sets on $X$. Let $U \subset X$ be open.
There is a canonical fibre product diagram
$$
\xymatrix{
\mathcal{F}^\#(U) \ar[d] \ar[r] &
\Pi(\mathcal{F})(U) \ar[d] \\
\prod_{x \in U} \mathcal{F}_x
\ar[r] &
\prod_{x \in U} \Pi(\mathcal{F})_x
}
$$
where the maps are the following:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The left vertical map has components
$\mathcal{F}^\#(U) \to \mathcal{F}^\#_x = \mathcal{F}_x$
where the equality is Lemma \ref{lemma-stalk-sheafification}.
\item The top horizontal map comes from the
map of presheaves $\mathcal{F} \to \Pi(\mathcal{F})$ described
in Section \ref{section-sheafification}.
\item The right vertical map has obvious component
maps $\Pi(\mathcal{F})(U) \to \Pi(\mathcal{F})_x$.
\item The bottom horizontal map has components
$\mathcal{F}_x \to \Pi(\mathcal{F})_x$
which come from the map of presheaves
$\mathcal{F} \to \Pi(\mathcal{F})$ described
in Section \ref{section-sheafification}.
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
It is clear that the diagram commutes. We have to show
it is a fibre product diagram.
A section $s \in \Pi(\mathcal{F})(U)$ is in $\mathcal{F}^\#$ if and
only if $(*)$ holds. But $(*)$ says that around every point
the section $s$ comes from a section of $\mathcal{F}$. By definition
of the stalk functors, this is equivalent to saying that
the value of $s$ in every stalk $\Pi(\mathcal{F})_x$ comes
from an element of the stalk $\mathcal{F}_x$. Hence the lemma.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-check-homomorphism-stalks}
let $X$ be a topological space.
Let $(\mathcal{C}, F)$ be one of the types of algebraic structures
listed in Lemma \ref{lemma-list-algebraic-structures}.
Suppose that $\mathcal{F}$, $\mathcal{G}$ are sheaves on $X$
with values in $\mathcal{C}$. Let $\varphi : \mathcal{F}
\to \mathcal{G}$ be a map of the underlying sheaves of sets.
If for all points $x \in X$ the map $\mathcal{F}_x \to
\mathcal{G}_x$ is a homomorphism of the algebraic structures,
then $\varphi$ is a morphism of sheaves of algebraic structures.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Let $U$ be an open subset of $X$. By assumption all the maps
\begin{eqnarray*}
\mathcal{F}_x & \to & \mathcal{G}_x \\
\Pi(\mathcal{F})(U) & \to & \Pi(\mathcal{G})(U) \\
\Pi(\mathcal{F})_x & \to & \Pi(\mathcal{G})_x
\end{eqnarray*}
are homomorphisms of algebraic structures (because $\Pi(-)$ is constructed
out of stalks). Hence we conclude by Lemma \ref{lemma-diagram-fibre-product}
and the fact that $F$ commutes with (fibre) products.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-sheafify-abelian-presheaf}
Let $X$ be a topological space.
Let $\mathcal{F}$ be an abelian presheaf on $X$.
Then there exists a unique structure of
abelian sheaf on $\mathcal{F}^\#$ such that
$\mathcal{F} \to \mathcal{F}^\#$ is a morphism
of abelian presheaves. Moreover, the following adjointness
property holds
$$
\text{Mor}_{\textit{PAb}(X)}(\mathcal{F}, i(\mathcal{G}))
=
\text{Mor}_{\textit{Ab}(X)}(\mathcal{F}^\#, \mathcal{G}).
$$
There is an analogous result for sheafification of
presheaves of algebraic structures as listed in
Lemma \ref{lemma-list-algebraic-structures}.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Recall the sheaf of sets $\Pi(\mathcal{F})$ defined in
Section \ref{section-sheafification}. All the stalks
$\mathcal{F}_x$ are abelian groups, see
Lemma \ref{lemma-stalk-abelian-presheaf}.
Hence $\Pi(\mathcal{F})$ is a sheaf of abelian groups by
Example \ref{example-sheaf-product-pointwise-algebraic-structure}.
Also, it is clear that the map $\mathcal{F} \to \Pi(\mathcal{F})$
is a morphism of abelian presheaves. If we show that
condition $(*)$ of Section \ref{section-sheafification} defines a subgroup
of $\Pi(\mathcal{F})(U)$ for all open subsets $U \subset X$,
then $\mathcal{F}^\#$ canonically inherits the structure of abelian sheaf.
This is quite easy to do by hand, and we leave it to the
reader to find a good simple argument. The argument we use here,
which generalizes is the following:
Lemma \ref{lemma-diagram-fibre-product} show that
$\mathcal{F}^\#(U)$ is the fibre product of a diagram
of abelian groups. Thus $\mathcal{F}^\#$ is an abelian
subgroup as desired.

\medskip\noindent
Note that at this point $\mathcal{F}^\#_x$ is an abelian
group by Lemma \ref{lemma-stalk-abelian-presheaf}
and that $\mathcal{F}_x \to \mathcal{F}^\#_x$ is a
bijection (Lemma \ref{lemma-stalk-sheafification})
and a homomorphism of abelian groups. Hence
$\mathcal{F}_x \to \mathcal{F}^\#_x$ is an isomorphism
of abelian groups. This will be used below without further mention.

\medskip\noindent
To prove the adjointness property we use the adjointness
property of sheafification of presheaves of sets. For example
if $\psi : \mathcal{F} \to i(\mathcal{G})$ is morphism of presheaves
then we obtain a morphism of sheaves
$\psi' : \mathcal{F}^\# \to \mathcal{G}$. What we have to do is to check
that this is a morphism of abelian sheaves. We may do this
for example by noting that it is true on stalks,
by Lemma \ref{lemma-stalk-sheafification}, and then using
Lemma \ref{lemma-check-homomorphism-stalks} above.
\end{proof}
