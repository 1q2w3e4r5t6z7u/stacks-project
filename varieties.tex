\section{Introduction}
\label{section-introduction}

\noindent
In this chapter we start studying varieties and more generally
schemes over a field. A fundamental reference is \cite{EGA}.








\section{Notation}
\label{section-notation}

\noindent
Throughout this chapter we use the letter $k$ to denote the ground field.










\section{Varieties}
\label{section-varieties}

\begin{definition}
\label{definition-variety}
Let $k$ be a field. A {\it variety} is a scheme $X$ over $k$
such that $X$ is integral and the structure morphism
$X \to \text{Spec}(k)$ is separated and of finite type.
\end{definition}

\noindent
This definition has the following drawback. Suppose that
$k \subset k'$ is an extension of fields. Suppose that $X$
is a variety over $k$. Then the base change
$X_{k'} = X \times_{\text{Spec}(k)} \text{Spec}(k')$ is
not necessarily a variety over $k'$. This will be discussed
in some detail in the following sections.

\medskip\noindent
In fact, even the product of two varieties need not be a variety
(this is really the same phenomenon). Here is an example.

\begin{example}
\label{example-product-not-a-variety}
Let $k = \mathbf{Q}$. Let $X = \text{Spec}(\mathbf{Q}(i))$
and $Y = \text{Spec}(\mathbf{Q}(i))$. Then the product
$X \times_{\text{Spec}(k)} Y$ of the varieties $X$ and $Y$
is not a variety, since it is reducible. (It is isomorphic
to the disjoint union of two copies of $X$.)
\end{example}







\section{Geometrically reduced schemes}
\label{section-geometrically-reduced}

\noindent
If $X$ is a reduced scheme over a field, then it can happen that $X$
becomes nonreduced after extending the ground field. This does not happen
for geometrically reduced schemes.

\begin{definition}
\label{definition-geometrically-reduced}
Let $k$ be a field.
Let $X$ be a scheme over $k$.
Let $x \in X$ be a point.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Let $x \in X$ be a point.
We say $X$ is {\it geometrically reduced at $x$}
if for any field extension $k \subset k'$
and any point $x' \in X_{k'}$ lying over $x$
the local ring $\mathcal{O}_{X_{k'}, x'}$ is reduced.
\item We say $X$ is {\it geometrically irreducible} over $k$
if $X$ is geometrically reduced at every point of $X$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

\noindent
This may seem a little mysterious at first, but it is
really the same thing as the notion discussed in the algebra chapter.
Here are some basic results explaining the connection.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-geometrically-reduced-at-point}
Let $k$ be a field.
Let $X$ be a scheme over $k$.
Let $x \in X$.
The following are equivalent
\begin{enumerate}
\item $X$ is geometrically reduced at $x$, and
\item the ring $\mathcal{O}_{X, x}$ is geometrically
reduced over $k$ (see
Algebra, Definition \ref{algebra-definition-geometrically-reduced}).
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Assume (1). This in particular implies that $\mathcal{O}_{X, x}$
is reduced. Let $k \subset k'$ be a finite purely inseparable field
extension. Consider the ring $\mathcal{O}_{X, x} \otimes_k k'$.
By Algebra, Lemma \ref{algebra-lemma-p-ring-map}
its spectrum is the same as the spectrum of $\mathcal{O}_{X, x}$.
Hence it is a local ring also
(Algebra, Lemma \ref{algebra-lemma-characterize-local-ring}).
Therefore there is a unique point $x' \in X_{k'}$ lying over $x$
and $\mathcal{O}_{X_{k'}, x'} \cong \mathcal{O}_{X, x} \otimes_k k'$.
By assumption this is a reduced ring. Hence we deduce (2) by
Algebra, Lemma
\ref{algebra-lemma-geometrically-reduced-finite-purely-inseparable-extension}.

\medskip\noindent
Assume (2). Let $k \subset k'$ be a field extension. Since
$\text{Spec}(k') \to \text{Spec}(k)$ is surjective, also
$X_{k'} \to X$ is surjective
(Morphisms, Lemma \ref{morphisms-lemma-base-change-surjective}).
Let $x' \in X_{k'}$ be any point lying over $x$.
The local ring $\mathcal{O}_{X_{k'}, x'}$
is a localization of the ring $\mathcal{O}_{X, x} \otimes_k k'$.
Hence it is reduced by assumption and (1) is proved.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-geometrically-reduced}
Let $k$ be a field.
Let $X$ be a scheme over $k$.
The following are equivalent
\begin{enumerate}
\item $X$ is geometrically reduced,
\item for every field extension $k \subset k'$ the scheme $X_{k'}$
is reduced, and
\item for every affine open $U \subset X$ the ring $\mathcal{O}_X(U)$
is geometrically reduced (see
Algebra, Definition \ref{algebra-definition-geometrically-reduced}).
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Assume (1). Then for every field extension $k \subset k'$ and
every point $x' \in X_{k'}$ the local ring of $X_{k'}$ at $x'$
is reduced. In other words $X_{k'}$ is reduced. Hence (2).

\medskip\noindent
Assume (2). Let $U \subset X$ be an affine open. Then for
every field extension $k \subset k'$ the scheme $X_{k'}$ is reduced, hence
$U_{k'} = \text{Spec}(\mathcal{O}(U)\otimes_k k')$ is reduced,
hence $\mathcal{O}(U)\otimes_k k'$ is reduced (see Properties,
Section \ref{properties-section-integral}). In other words
$\mathcal{O}(U)$ is geometrically reduced, so (3) holds.

\medskip\noindent
Assume (3). For any field extension $k \subset k'$ the base
change $X_{k'}$ is gotten by gluing the spectra of the
rings $\mathcal{O}_X(U) \otimes_k k'$ where $U$ is affine open
in $X$ (see Schemes, Section \ref{schemes-section-fibre-products}).
Hence $X_{k'}$ is reduced. So (1) holds.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-check-only-finite-inseparable-extensions}
Let $k$ be a field. Let $X$ be a scheme over $k$.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Let $x \in X$, and assume $\mathcal{O}_{X, x}$ reduced.
To check that $X$ is geometrically reduced at $x$ it suffices to check
$\mathcal{O}_{X_{k'}, x'}$ is reduced for every
finite purely inseparable field extension $k'$ of $k$ and
$x' \in X_{k'}$ over $x$.
\item Assume $X$ reduced.
To see that $X$ is geometrically reduced it suffices to check
$X_{k'}$ is reduced for every finite purely inseparable field
extension $k'/k$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
This follows from Lemmas \ref{lemma-geometrically-reduced-at-point}
and \ref{lemma-geometrically-reduced} above and Algebra, Lemma
\ref{algebra-lemma-geometrically-reduced-finite-purely-inseparable-extension}.
Details omitted.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-perfect-reduced}
Let $X$ be a scheme over a perfect field $k$.
If $X$ is reduced, then $X$ is geometrically reduced over $k$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Follows immediately from
Lemma \ref{lemma-check-only-finite-inseparable-extensions}
and the definition of a perfect field
(Algebra, Definition \ref{algebra-definition-perfect}).
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-geometrically-reduced-any-base-change}
Let $k$ be a field.
Let $X$, $Y$ be schemes over $k$.
\begin{enumerate}
\item If $X$ is geometrically reduced at $x$, and $Y$ reduced,
then $X \times_k Y$ is reduced at every point lying over $x$.
\item If $X$ geometrically reduced over $k$ and $Y$ reduced.
Then $X \times_k Y$ is reduced.
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Combine, Lemmas \ref{lemma-geometrically-reduced-at-point}
and \ref{lemma-geometrically-reduced} and Algebra,
Lemma \ref{algebra-lemma-geometrically-reduced-any-reduced-base-change}.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-Noetherian-geometrically-reduced-at-point}
Let $k$ be a field.
Let $X$ be a scheme over $k$.
Let $x \in X$.
Assume $X$ locally Noetherian and geometrically reduced at $x$.
Then there exists an open neighbourhood $U \subset X$ of $x$
which is geometrically reduced over $k$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Let $R$ be a Noetherian $k$-algebra.
Let $\mathfrak p \subset R$ be a prime.
Let $I = \text{Ker}(R \to R_{\mathfrak p}$.
Since $IR_{\mathfrak p} = R_{\mathfrak p}$ and $I$ is finitely generated
there exists an $f \in R$, $f \not \in \mathfrak p$ such that $fI = 0$. 
Hence $R_f \subset R_{\mathfrak p}$.

\medskip\noindent
Assume $X$ locally Noetherian and geometrically reduced at $x$.
If we apply the above to $R = \mathcal{O}_X(U)$ for some affine
open neighbourhood of $x$, and $\mathfrak p \subset R$ the prime
corresponding to $x$, then we see that after shrinking $U$ we may
assume $R \subset R_{\mathfrak p}$. By
Lemma \ref{lemma-geometrically-reduced-at-point} the assumption
means that $R_{\mathfrak p}$ is geometrically reduced over $k$.
By Algebra, Lemma \ref{algebra-lemma-subalgebra-separable}
this implies that $R$ is geometrically reduced over $k$, which
in turn implies that $U$ is geometrically reduced.
\end{proof}

\begin{example}
\label{example-not-geometrically-reduced}
Let $k = \mathbf{F}_p(s, t)$, i.e., a purely transcendental extension
of the prime field. Consider the variety
$X = \text{Spec}(k[x, y]/(1 + sx^p + ty^p))$.
Let $k \subset k'$ be any extension such that
both $s$ and $t$ have a $p$th root in $k'$.
Then the base change $X_{k'}$ is not reduced.
Namely, the ring $k'[x, y]/(1 + s x^p + ty^p)$ contains the element
$1 + s^{1/p}x + t^{1/p}y$ whose $p$th power is zero but
which is not zero (since the ideal $(1 + sx^p + ty^p)$ certainly
does not contain any nonzero element of degree $< p$).
\end{example}






\section{Geometrically connected schemes}
\label{section-geometrically-connected}

\noindent
If $X$ is a connected scheme over a field, then it can happen that $X$
becomes disconnected after extending the ground field. This does not happen
for geometrically connected schemes.

\begin{definition}
\label{definition-geometrically-connected}
Let $X$ be a scheme over the field $k$.
We say $X$ is {\it geometrically connected} over $k$
if the scheme $X_{k'}$ is connected\footnote{An empty scheme is connected.}
for every field extension $k'$ of $k$.
\end{definition}

\noindent
Here is an example of a variety which is not geometrically connected.

\begin{example}
\label{example-not-geometrically-irreducible}
Let $k = \mathbf{Q}$. The scheme
$X = \text{Spec}(\mathbf{Q}(i))$ is a variety over $\text{Spec}(\mathbf{Q})$.
But the base change $X_{\mathbf{C}}$ is the spectrum of
$\mathbf{C} \otimes_{\mathbf{Q}} \mathbf{Q}(i) \cong
\mathbf{C} \times \mathbf{C}$ which is the disjoint union of
two copies of $\text{Spec}(\mathbf{C})$. So in fact, this is an
example of a non-geometrically connected variety.
\end{example}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-bijection-connected-components}
Let $k$ be a field.
Let $X$, $Y$ be schemes over $k$.
Assume $X$ is geometrically connected over $k$.
Then the projection morphism
$$
p : X \times_k Y \longrightarrow Y
$$
induces a bijection between connected components.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
First, note that the scheme theoretic fibres of $p$ are connected
and nonempty, since they
are base changes of the geometrically connected scheme $X$ by
field extensions. Moreover the scheme theoretic fibres are
homeomorphic to the set theoretic fibres, see
Schemes, Lemma \ref{schemes-lemma-fibre-topological}.
By Morphisms, Lemma \ref{morphisms-lemma-scheme-over-field-universally-open}
the map $p$ is open.
Thus we may apply Topology,
Lemma \ref{topology-lemma-connected-fibres-connected-components}
to conclude.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-affine-geometrically-connected}
Let $k$ be a field.
Let $A$ be a $k$-algebra.
Then $X = \text{Spec}(A)$ is geometrically connected over $k$
if and only if $A$ is geometrically connected over $k$ (see
Algebra, Definition \ref{algebra-definition-geometrically-connected}).
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Immediate from the definitions.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-separably-closed-field-connected-components}
Let $k \subset k'$ be an extension of fields.
Let $X$ be a scheme over $k$. Set $X' = X_{k'}$.
Assume $k$ separably algebraically closed.
Then the morphism $X' \to X$ induces a bijection of connected
components.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Since $k$ is separably algebraically closed we see that
$k'$ is geometrically connected over $k$, see Algebra,
Lemma \ref{algebra-lemma-separably-closed-connected-implies-geometric}.
Hence $Z = \text{Spec}(k')$ is geometrically connected over $k$.
by Lemma \ref{lemma-affine-geometrically-connected} above.
Since $X' = Z \times_k X$ the result is a special case
of Lemma \ref{lemma-bijection-connected-components}.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-characterize-geometrically-connected}
Let $k$ be a field.
Let $X$ be a scheme over $k$.
Let $\overline{k}$ be a separable algebraic closure of $k$.
Then $X$ is geometrically connected if and only if the base change
$X_{\overline{k}}$ is connected.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Assume $X_{\overline{k}}$ is connected.
Let $k \subset k'$ be a field extension.
There exists a field extension $\overline{k} \subset \overline{k}'$
such that $k'$ embeds into $\overline{k}'$ as an extension of $k$.
By Lemma \ref{lemma-separably-closed-field-connected-components}
we see that $X_{\overline{k}'}$ is connected.
Since $X_{\overline{k}'} \to X_{k'}$ is surjective we conclude
that $X_{k'}$ is connected as desired.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-descend-open}
Let $k$ be a field.
Let $X$ be a scheme over $k$.
Let $A$ be a $k$-algebra.
Assume $X$ is quasi-compact.
Let $V \subset X_A$ be a quasi-compact open.
Then there exists a finitely generated $k$-subalgebra $A' \subset A$
and a quasi-compact open $V' \subset X_{A'}$
such that $V = V'_A$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
We remark that if $X$ is also quasi-separated this follows from
Limits, Lemma \ref{limits-lemma-descend-opens}. Let
$X = U_1 \cup \ldots \cup U_n$ be a finite affine open
covering. Say $U_i = \text{Spec}(R_i)$.
Since $V$ is quasi-compact we can find finitely many
$f_{ij} \in R_i \otimes_k A$, $j = 1, \ldots, n_i$
such that $V = \bigcup_i \bigcup_{j = 1, \ldots, n_i} D(f_{ij})$
where $D(f_{ij}) \subset U_{i, A}$ is the corresponding standard
open. (We do not claim that $V \cap U_{i, A}$ is the union
of the $D(f_{ij})$, $j = 1, \ldots, n_i$.)
It is clear that we can find a finitely generated $k$-subalgebra
$A' \subset A$ such that $f_{ij}$ is the image of some
$f_{ij}' \in R_i \otimes_k A'$.
Set $V' = \bigcup D(f_{ij}')$ which is a quasi-compact open of $X_{A'}$.
Denote $\pi : X_A \to X_{A'}$ the canonical morphism.
We have $\pi(V) \subset V'$ as $\pi(D(f_{ij})) \subset D(f_{ij}')$.
If $x \in X_A$ with $\pi(x) \in V'$, then $\pi(x) \in D(f_{ij}')$
for some $i, j$ and we see that $x \in D(f_{ij})$ as $f_{ij}'$
maps to $f_{ij}$. Thus we see that $V = \pi^{-1}(V')$ as desired.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-characterize-geometrically-connected-quasi-compact}
Let $k$ be a field. Let $X$ be a scheme over $k$.
Assume $X$ is quasi-compact. The following are
equivalent:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $X$ is geometrically connected over $k$, and
\item for every finite separable field extension $k \subset k'$
the scheme $X_{k'}$ is connected.
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Let $k \subset \overline{k}$ be a separable algebraic closure of $k$.
By Lemma \ref{lemma-characterize-geometrically-connected} it suffices
to prove the following statement:
If $X_{\overline{k}}$ is disconnected, then also $X_{k'}$ is
disconnected for some finite subextension $k \subset k' \subset \overline{k}$.
We will give two proofs of this fact.

\medskip\noindent
First proof.
Let $X = U_1 \cup \ldots \cup U_n$ be a finite affine open
covering. Say $U_i = \text{Spec}(A_i)$. If $X_{\overline{k}}$ is disconnected
then there exist an open and closed subscheme
$\overline{V} \subset X_{\overline{k}}$ which is neither empty
nor equal to $X_{\overline{k}}$. For each $i$ we see that
$\overline{V} \cap U_{i, \overline{k}}$ corresponds to an
idempotent $e_i \in A_i \otimes_k \overline{k}$, see
Algebra, Lemma \ref{algebra-lemma-disjoint-decomposition}. Moreover, at
least for one $i$ the idempotent $e_i$ is a nontrivial idempotent.
Clearly, we can find a finite subextension $k \subset k' \subset \overline{k}$
such that each $e_i$ is actually an element of $A_i \otimes_k k'$.
Write $A_{ij} = \Gamma(U_i \cap U_j, \mathcal{O}_X)$.
We remark that
$$
A_{ij} \otimes_k k'
\longrightarrow
\Gamma((U_i \cap U_j)_{k'}, \mathcal{O}_{X_{k'}})
=
\Gamma(U_{i, k'} \cap U_{j, k'}, \mathcal{O}_{X_{k'}})
$$
is injective for all field extensions $k \subset k'$ (verification omitted).
Thus the $e_i \in A_i \otimes_k k'$ glue to a global idempotent
$e' \in \Gamma(X_{k'}, \mathcal{O})$.
Then it is clear that $\overline{U}$ comes from the open and closed
subscheme $U' \subset X_{k'}$ corresponding to $e'$.

\medskip\noindent
Second proof.
Write $X_{\overline{k}} = U \coprod V$ with both $U$ and $V$ open and
closed (in particular quasi-compact).
By Lemma \ref{lemma-descend-open} there exists a finite subextension
$k \subset k' \subset \overline{k}$ and opens $U', V' \subset X_{k'}$
which pull back to $U$ and $V$. Since $X_{\overline{k}} \to X_{k'}$
is surjective we coclude that $X_{k'} = U' \coprod V'$ as desired.
\end{proof}

\noindent
Let $k$ be a field. Let $k \subset \overline{k}$ be a (possibly infinite)
Galois extension. For example $\overline{k}$ could be the
separable algebraic closure of $k$.
For any $\sigma \in \text{Gal}(\overline{k}/k)$ we get a corresponding
automorphism
$
\text{Spec}(\sigma) :
\text{Spec}(\overline{k})
\longrightarrow
\text{Spec}(\overline{k})
$.
Note that
$\text{Spec}(\sigma) \circ \text{Spec}(\tau) = \text{Spec}(\tau \circ \sigma)$.
Hence we get an action
$$
\text{Gal}(\overline{k}/k)^{opp} \times \text{Spec}(\overline{k})
\longrightarrow
\text{Spec}(\overline{k})
$$
of the opposite group on the scheme $\text{Spec}(\overline{k})$.
Let $X$ be a scheme over $k$. Since
$X_{\overline{k}} =
\text{Spec}(\overline{k}) \times_{\text{Spec}(k)} X$
by definition we see that the action above induces a canonical action
\begin{equation}
\label{equation-galois-action-base-change-kbar}
\text{Gal}(\overline{k}/k)^{opp} \times X_{\overline{k}}
\longrightarrow
X_{\overline{k}}.
\end{equation}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-closed-fixed-by-Galois}
Let $k$ be a field. Let $k \subset \overline{k}$ be a (possibly infinite)
Galois extension. Let $X$ be a scheme over $k$. Let
$\overline{T} \subset X_{\overline{k}}$ have the following properties
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\overline{T}$ is a closed subset of $X_{\overline{k}}$,
\item for every $\sigma \in \text{Gal}(\overline{k}/k)$
we have $\sigma(\overline{T}) = \overline{T}$.
\end{enumerate}
Then there exists a closed subset $T \subset X$ whose inverse image
in $X_{k'}$ is $\overline{T}$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
This lemma immediately reduces to the case where $X = \text{Spec}(A)$
is affine. In this case, let $\overline{I} \subset A \otimes_k \overline{k}$
be the radical ideal corresponding to $\overline{T}$.
Assumption (2) implies that $\sigma(\overline{I}) = \overline{I}$
for all $\sigma \in \text{Gal}(\overline{k}/k)$.
Pick $x \in \overline{I}$. There exists a finite Galois extension
$k \subset k'$ contained in $\overline{k}$ such that $x \in A \otimes_k k'$.
Set $G = \text{Gal}(k'/k)$. Set
$$
P(T) = \prod\nolimits_{\sigma \in G} (T - \sigma(x)) \in (A \otimes_k k')[T]
$$
It is clear that $P(T)$ is monic and is actually an element of
$(A \otimes_k k')^G[T] = A[T]$ (by basic Galois theory).
Moreover, if we write $P(T) = T^d + a_1T^{d - 1} + \ldots + a_0$
the we see that $a_i \in I := A \cap \overline{I}$. By
Algebra, Lemma \ref{algebra-lemma-polynomials-divide}
we see that $x$ is contained in the radical of $I(A \otimes_k \overline{k})$.
Hence $\overline{I}$ is the radical of $I(A \otimes_k \overline{k})$ and
setting $T = V(I)$ is a solution.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-tricky}
Let $k$ be a field. Let $k \subset \overline{k}$ be a (possibly infinite)
Galois extension. Let $X$ be a scheme over $k$. Let $T \subset X$ be
a nonempty closed subset. Assume $T_{\overline{k}}$ connected, and
assume $X_{\overline{k}}$ disconnected. Then $X$ is disconnected.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Write $X_{\overline{k}} = \overline{U} \coprod \overline{V}$
with $\overline{U}$ and $\overline{V}$ open and closed.
Since $T_{\overline{k}}$ is connected we see that
$T_{\overline{k}}$ is contained in either $\overline{U}$ or $\overline{V}$.
Say $T_{\overline{k}} \subset \overline{U}$.

\medskip\noindent
Fix a quasi-compact open $W \subset X$. There exists a
finite Galois subextension $k \subset k' \subset \overline{k}$
such that $\overline{U} \cap W_{\overline{k}}$ and
$\overline{V} \cap W_{\overline{k}}$ come from quasi-compact
opens $U', V' \subset W_{k'}$. Then also $W_{k'} = U' \coprod V'$.
Consider
$$
U'' = \bigcap\nolimits_{\sigma \in \text{Gal}(k'/k)} \sigma(U'),
\quad
V'' = \bigcup\nolimits_{\sigma \in \text{Gal}(k'/k)} \sigma(V').
$$
These are Galois invariant, open and closed, and
$W_{k'} = U'' \coprod V''$.
By Lemma \ref{lemma-closed-fixed-by-Galois} we get open and closed subsets
$U_W, V_W \subset W$ such that
$U'' = (U_W)_{k'}$, $V'' = (V_W)_{k'}$ and
$W = U_W \coprod V_W$.

\medskip\noindent
We claim that if $W \subset W' \subset X$ are quasi-compact
open, then $W \cap U_{W'} = U_W$ and $W \cap V_{W'} = V_W$.
Verification omitted.
Hence we see that upon defining $U = \bigcup_{W \subset X} U_W$
and $V = \bigcup_{W \subset X} V_W$ we obtain $X = U \coprod V$.
It is clear that $V$ is nonempty as it is constructed by taking
unions (locally). On the other hand, $U$ is nonempty since it contains
$T$ by construction.
\end{proof}

\noindent
Let $X$ be a scheme. We denote $\pi_0(X)$ the set of connected
components of $X$.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-galois-action-connected-components}
Let $k$ be a field, with separable algebraic closure $\overline{k}$.
Let $X$ be a scheme over $k$.
There is an action
$$
\text{Gal}(\overline{k}/k)^{opp} \times \pi_0(X_{\overline{k}})
\longrightarrow
\pi_0(X_{\overline{k}})
$$
with the following properties:
\begin{enumerate}
\item An element $\overline{T} \in \pi_0(X_{\overline{k}})$
is fixed by the action if and only if there exists a connected component
$T \subset X$, which is geometrically connected over $k$,
such that $T_{\overline{k}} = \overline{T}$.
\item For any field extension $k \subset k'$ with separable
algebraic closure $\overline{k}'$ the diagram
$$
\xymatrix{
\text{Gal}(\overline{k}'/k') \times \pi_0(X_{\overline{k}'})
\ar[r] \ar[d] &
\pi_0(X_{\overline{k}'}) \ar[d] \\
\text{Gal}(\overline{k}/k) \times \pi_0(X_{\overline{k}})
\ar[r] &
\pi_0(X_{\overline{k}})
}
$$
is commutative (where the right vertical arrow is a bijection
according to Lemma \ref{lemma-separably-closed-field-connected-components}).
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
The action (\ref{equation-galois-action-base-change-kbar})
of $\text{Gal}(\overline{k}/k)$ on $X_{\overline{k}}$
induces an action on its connected components.
Connected components are always closed
(Topology, Lemma \ref{topology-lemma-connected-components}).
Hence if $\overline{T}$ is as in (1), then by
Lemma \ref{lemma-closed-fixed-by-Galois} there exists a closed
subset $T \subset X$ such that $\overline{T} = T_{\overline{k}}$.
Note that $T$ is geometrically connected over $k$, see
Lemma \ref{lemma-characterize-geometrically-connected}.
To see that $T$ is a connected component of $X$, suppose that
$T \subset T'$, $T \not = T'$ where $T'$ is a connected component of $X$.
In this case $T'_{k'}$ strictly contains $\overline{T}$ and hence is
disconnnected. By Lemma \ref{lemma-tricky} this means that $T'$ is
disconnected! Contradiction.

\medskip\noindent
We omit the proof of the functoriality in (2).
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-galois-action-connected-components-continuous}
Let $k$ be a field, with separable algebraic closure $\overline{k}$.
Let $X$ be a scheme over $k$.
Assume
\begin{enumerate}
\item $X$ is quasi-compact, and
\item the connected components of $X_{\overline{k}}$ are open.
\end{enumerate}
Then
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(a)] $\pi_0(X_{\overline{k}})$ is finite, and
\item[(b)] the action of $\text{Gal}(\overline{k}/k)$ on
$\pi_0(X_{\overline{k}})$ is continuous.
\end{enumerate}
Moreover, assumptions (1) and (2) are satisfied when $X$ is
of finite type over $k$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Since the connected components are open, cover $X_{\overline{k}}$
(Topology, Lemma \ref{topology-lemma-connected-components}) and
$X_{\overline{k}}$ is quasi-compact, we conclude that there are only
finitely many of them. Thus (a) holds.
By Lemma \ref{lemma-descend-open} these connected components
are each defined over a finite subextension of $k \subset \overline{k}$
and we get (b).
If $X$ is of finite type over $k$, then $X_{\overline{k}}$ is of finite
type over $\overline{k}$
(Morphisms, Lemma \ref{morphisms-lemma-base-change-finite-type}).
Hence $X_{\overline{k}}$ is a Noetherian scheme
(Morphisms, Lemma \ref{morphisms-lemma-finite-type-noetherian}) and has
an underlying Noetherian topological space
(Properties, Lemma \ref{properties-lemma-Noetherian-topology}).
Thus $X_{\overline{k}}$ has finitely many irreducible components
(Topology, Lemma \ref{topology-lemma-Noetherian})
and a fortiori finitely many connected components (which are
therefore open).
\end{proof}









\section{Geometrically irreducible schemes}
\label{section-geometrically-irreducible}

\noindent
If $X$ is an irreducible scheme over a field, then it can happen that $X$
becomes reducible after extending the ground field. This does not happen
for geometrically irreducible schemes.

\begin{definition}
\label{definition-geometrically-irreducible}
Let $X$ be a scheme over the field $k$.
We say $X$ is {\it geometrically irreducible} over $k$ if the scheme
$X_{k'}$ is irreducible\footnote{An irreducible space is nonempty.}
for any field extension $k'$ of $k$.
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-separably-closed-irreducible}
Let $X$ be a scheme over a separably closed field $k$.
If $X$ is irreducible, then $X_K$ is irreducible for any
field extension $k \subset K$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Use Properties, Lemma \ref{properties-lemma-characterize-irreducible}
and Algebra, Lemma \ref{algebra-lemma-separably-closed-irreducible}.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-bijection-irreducible-components}
Let $k$ be a field.
Let $X$, $Y$ be schemes over $k$.
Assume $X$ is geometrically irreducible over $k$.
Then the projection morphism
$$
p : X \times_k Y \longrightarrow Y
$$
induces a bijection between irreducible components.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
First, note that the scheme theoretic fibres of $p$ are irreducible,
since they are base changes of the geometrically irreducible scheme $X$
by field extensions. Moreover the scheme theoretic fibres are
homeomorphic to the set theoretic fibres, see
Schemes, Lemma \ref{schemes-lemma-fibre-topological}.
By Morphisms, Lemma \ref{morphisms-lemma-scheme-over-field-universally-open}
the map $p$ is open.
Thus we may apply Topology,
Lemma \ref{topology-lemma-irreducible-fibres-irreducible-components}
to conclude.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-geometrically-irreducible-local}
Let $k$ be a field. Let $X$ be a scheme over $k$.
The following are equivalent
\begin{enumerate}
\item $X$ is geometrically irreducible over $k$,
\item for every affine open $U$ the $k$-algebra $\mathcal{O}_X(U)$
is geometrivcally irreducible over $k$ (see
Algebra, Definition \ref{algebra-definition-geometrically-irreducible}),
\item $X$ is irreducible and there exists an affine open covering
$X = \bigcup U_i$ such that each $k$-algebra $\mathcal{O}_X(U_i)$ is
geometrically irreducible, and
\item there exists an open covering $X = \bigcup_{i \in I} X_i$ such
that $X_i$ is geometrically irreducible for each $i$ and such that
$X_i \cap X_j \not = \emptyset$ for all $i, j \in I$.
\end{enumerate}
Moreover, if $X$ is geometrically irreducible so is every
open subscheme of $X$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
An affine scheme $\text{Spec}(A)$ over $k$ is geometrically
irreducible if and only if $A$ is geometrically irreducible over $k$;
this is immediate from the definitions.
Recall that if a scheme is irreducible so is every nonempty
open subscheme of $X$, any two nonempty open subsets have
a nonempty intersection. Also, if every affine open is irreducible
then the scheme is irreducible, see Properties,
Lemma \ref{properties-lemma-characterize-irreducible}.
Hence the final statement of the lemma
is clear, as well as the implications (1) $\Rightarrow$ (2),
(2) $\Rightarrow$ (3), and (3) $\Rightarrow$ (4). If (4) holds,
then for any field extension $k'/k$ the scheme $X_{k'}$
has a covering by irreducible opens which pairwise intersect.
Hence $X_{k'}$ is irreducible. Hence (4) implies (1).
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-separably-closed-field-irreducible-components}
Let $k \subset k'$ be an extension of fields.
Let $X$ be a scheme over $k$. Set $X' = X_{k'}$.
Assume $k$ separably algebraically closed.
Then the morphism $X' \to X$ induces a bijection of irreducible components.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Since $k$ is separably algebraically closed we see that
$k'$ is geometrically irreducible over $k$, see Algebra,
Lemma \ref{algebra-lemma-separably-closed-irreducible-implies-geometric}.
Hence $Z = \text{Spec}(k')$ is geometrically irreducible over $k$.
by Lemma \ref{lemma-geometrically-irreducible-local} above.
Since $X' = Z \times_k X$ the result is a special case
of Lemma \ref{lemma-bijection-irreducible-components}.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-characterize-geometrically-irreducible}
Let $k$ be a field. Let $X$ be a scheme over $k$.
Assume $X$ is quasi-compact. The following are equivalent:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $X$ is geometrically irreducible over $k$,
\item for every finite separable field extension $k \subset k'$
the scheme $X_{k'}$ is irreducible, and
\item $X_{\overline{k}}$ is irreducible, where $k \subset \overline{k}$
is a separable algebraic closure of $k$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Assume $X_{\overline{k}}$ is irreducible, i.e., assume (3).
Let $k \subset k'$ be a field extension.
There exists a field extension $\overline{k} \subset \overline{k}'$
such that $k'$ embeds into $\overline{k}'$ as an extension of $k$.
By Lemma \ref{lemma-separably-closed-field-irreducible-components}
we see that $X_{\overline{k}'}$ is irreducible.
Since $X_{\overline{k}'} \to X_{k'}$ is surjective we conclude
that $X_{k'}$ is irreducible. Hence (1) holds.

\medskip\noindent
Let $k \subset \overline{k}$ be a separable algebraic closure of $k$.
Assume not (3), i.e., assume $X_{\overline{k}}$ is reducible.
Our goal is to show that also $X_{k'}$ is
reducible for some finite subextension
$k \subset k' \subset \overline{k}$.
Let $X = \bigcup_{i \in I} U_i$ be an affine open covering
with $U_i$ not empty. If for some $i$ the scheme
$U_i$ is reducible, or if for some pair $i \not = j$ the
intersection $U_i \cap U_j$ is empty, then $X$ is reducible
(Properties, Lemma \ref{properties-lemma-characterize-irreducible})
and we are done.
In particular we may assume that
$U_{i, \overline{k}} \cap U_{j, \overline{k}}$ for all $i, j \in I$
is nonempty and we conclude that $U_{i, \overline{k}}$ has
to be reducible for some $i$. According to
Algebra, Lemma \ref{algebra-lemma-geometrically-irreducible}
this means that $U_{i, k'}$ is reducible for some
finite separable field extension $k \subset k'$.
Hence also $X_{k'}$ is reducible. Thus we see that
(2) implies (3).

\medskip\noindent
The implication (1) $\Rightarrow$ (2) is immediate.
This proves the lemma.
\end{proof}

\noindent
Let $X$ be a scheme. We denote $\text{IrredComp}(X)$ the set of
irreducible components of $X$.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-galois-action-irreducible-components}
Let $k$ be a field, with separable algebraic closure $\overline{k}$.
Let $X$ be a scheme over $k$.
There is an action
$$
\text{Gal}(\overline{k}/k)^{opp} \times \text{IrredComp}(X_{\overline{k}})
\longrightarrow
\text{IrredComp}(X_{\overline{k}})
$$
with the following properties:
\begin{enumerate}
\item An element $\overline{T} \in \text{IrredComp}(X_{\overline{k}})$
is fixed by the action if and only if there exists an irreducible
component $T \subset X$, which is geometrically irreducible over $k$,
such that $T_{\overline{k}} = \overline{T}$.
\item For any field extension $k \subset k'$ with separable
algebraic closure $\overline{k}'$ the diagram
$$
\xymatrix{
\text{Gal}(\overline{k}'/k') \times \text{IrredComp}(X_{\overline{k}'})
\ar[r] \ar[d] &
\text{IrredComp}(X_{\overline{k}'}) \ar[d] \\
\text{Gal}(\overline{k}/k) \times \text{IrredComp}(X_{\overline{k}})
\ar[r] &
\text{IrredComp}(X_{\overline{k}})
}
$$
is commutative (where the right vertical arrow is a bijection
according to Lemma \ref{lemma-separably-closed-field-irreducible-components}).
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
The action (\ref{equation-galois-action-base-change-kbar})
of $\text{Gal}(\overline{k}/k)$ on $X_{\overline{k}}$
induces an action on its irreducible components.
Irreducible components are always closed
(Topology, Lemma \ref{topology-lemma-connected-components}).
Hence if $\overline{T}$ is as in (1), then by
Lemma \ref{lemma-closed-fixed-by-Galois} there exists a closed
subset $T \subset X$ such that $\overline{T} = T_{\overline{k}}$.
Note that $T$ is geometrically irreducible over $k$, see
Lemma \ref{lemma-characterize-geometrically-irreducible}.
To see that $T$ is an irreducible component of $X$, suppose that
$T \subset T'$, $T \not = T'$ where $T'$ is an irreducible
component of $X$. Let $\overline{\eta}$ be the generic point of
$\overline{T}$. It maps to the generic point $\eta$ of $T$.
Then the generic point $\xi \in T'$ specializes to $\eta$.
As $X_{\overline{k}} \to X$ is flat there exists a point
$\overline{\xi} \in X_{\overline{k}}$ which maps to $\xi$ and
specializes to $\overline{\eta}$. It follows that
the closure of the singleton $\{\overline{\xi}\}$ is an
irreducible closed subset of $X_{\overline{\xi}}$ which
strictly contains $\overline{T}$. This is the desired contradiction.

\medskip\noindent
We omit the proof of the functoriality in (2).
\end{proof}













\section{Geometrically integral schemes}
\label{section-geometrically-integral}

\noindent
If $X$ is an irreducible scheme over a field, then it can happen that $X$
becomes reducible after extending the ground field. This does not happen
for geometrically irreducible schemes.

\begin{definition}
\label{definition-geometrically-integral}
Let $X$ be a scheme over the field $k$.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Let $x \in X$. We say $X$ is
{\it geometrically pointwise integral at $x$} if for every
field extension $k \subset k'$ and every $x' \in X_{k'}$ lying over $x$
the local ring $\mathcal{O}_{X_{k'}, x'}$ is integral.
\item We say $X$ is {\it geometrically pointwise integral} if $X$
is geometrically pointwise integral at every point.
\item We say $X$ is {\it geometrically integral} over $k$ if the scheme
$X_{k'}$ is integral for every field extension $k'$ of $k$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

\noindent
The distinction between notions (2) and (3) is necessary.
For example if $k = \mathbf{R}$ and $X = \text{Spec}(\mathbf{C}[x])$,
then $X$ is geometrically pointwise integral over $\mathbf{R}$ but
of course not geometrically integral.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-geometrically-integral}
Let $k$ be a field.
Let $X$ be a scheme over $k$.
Then $X$ is geometrically integral over $k$ if and only if
$X$ is both geometrically reduced and geometrically irreducible
over $k$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
See Properties, Lemma \ref{properties-lemma-characterize-integral}.
\end{proof}





\section{Geometrically normal schemes}
\label{section-geometrically-normal}

\noindent
In Properties, Definition \ref{properties-definition-normal}
we have defined the notion of a normal scheme.
This notion is defined even for non-Noetherian
schemes. Hence, contrary to our discussion of
``geometrically regular'' schemes we consider all
field extensions of the ground field.

\begin{definition}
\label{definition-geometrically-normal}
Let $X$ be a scheme over the field $k$.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Let $x \in X$. We say $X$ is
{\it geometrically normal at $x$} if for every
field extension $k \subset k'$ and every $x' \in X_{k'}$ lying over $x$
the local ring $\mathcal{O}_{X_{k'}, x'}$ is normal.
\item We say $X$ is {\it geometrically normal} over $k$ if $X$
is geometrically normal at every $x \in X$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-geometrically-normal-at-point}
Let $k$ be a field.
Let $X$ be a scheme over $k$.
Let $x \in X$.
The following are equivalent
\begin{enumerate}
\item $X$ is geometrically normal at $x$, and
\item the ring $\mathcal{O}_{X, x}$ is geometrically
normal over $k$ (see
Algebra, Definition \ref{algebra-definition-geometrically-normal}).
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Assume (1). This in particular implies that $\mathcal{O}_{X, x}$
is a normal domain. Let $k \subset k'$ be a finite purely inseparable field
extension. Consider the ring $\mathcal{O}_{X, x} \otimes_k k'$.
By Algebra, Lemma \ref{algebra-lemma-p-ring-map}
its spectrum is the same as the spectrum of $\mathcal{O}_{X, x}$.
Hence it is a local ring also
(Algebra, Lemma \ref{algebra-lemma-characterize-local-ring}).
Therefore there is a unique point $x' \in X_{k'}$ lying over $x$
and $\mathcal{O}_{X_{k'}, x'} \cong \mathcal{O}_{X, x} \otimes_k k'$.
By assumption this is a normal ring. Hence we deduce (2) by
Algebra, Lemma
\ref{algebra-lemma-geometrically-normal}.

\medskip\noindent
Assume (2). Let $k \subset k'$ be a field extension. Since
$\text{Spec}(k') \to \text{Spec}(k)$ is surjective, also
$X_{k'} \to X$ is surjective
(Morphisms, Lemma \ref{morphisms-lemma-base-change-surjective}).
Let $x' \in X_{k'}$ be any point lying over $x$.
The local ring $\mathcal{O}_{X_{k'}, x'}$
is a localization of the ring $\mathcal{O}_{X, x} \otimes_k k'$.
Hence it is normal by assumption and (1) is proved.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-geometrically-normal}
Let $k$ be a field.
Let $X$ be a scheme over $k$.
The following are equivalent
\begin{enumerate}
\item $X$ is geometrically normal,
\item $X_{k'}$ is a normal scheme for every field extension $k \subset k'$,
\item $X_{k'}$ is a normal scheme for every finitely generated field
extension $k \subset k'$,
\item $X_{k'}$ is a normal scheme for every finite purely inseparable
field extension $k \subset k'$, and
\item for every affine open $U \subset X$ the ring $\mathcal{O}_X(U)$
is geometrically normal (see
Algebra, Definition \ref{algebra-definition-geometrically-reduced}).
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Assume (1). Then for every field extension $k \subset k'$ and
every point $x' \in X_{k'}$ the local ring of $X_{k'}$ at $x'$
is normal. By definition this means that $X_{k'}$ is normal.
Hence (2).

\medskip\noindent
It is clear that (2) implies (3) implies (4).

\medskip\noindent
Assume (4) and let $U \subset X$ be an affine open subscheme.
Then $U_{k'}$ is a normal scheme for any finite purely inseparable
extension $k \subset k'$ (including $k = k'$). This means that
$k' \otimes_k \mathcal{O}(U)$ is a normal ring for all
finite purely inseparable extensions $k \subset k'$. Hence
$\mathcal{O}(U)$ is a geometrically normal $k$-algebra by definition.

\medskip\noindent
Assume (5). For any field extension $k \subset k'$ the base
change $X_{k'}$ is gotten by gluing the spectra of the
rings $\mathcal{O}_X(U) \otimes_k k'$ where $U$ is affine open
in $X$ (see Schemes, Section \ref{schemes-section-fibre-products}).
Hence $X_{k'}$ is normal. So (1) holds.
\end{proof}












\section{Change of fields and locally Noetherian schemes}
\label{section-locally-Noetherian}

\noindent
Let $X$ a locally Noetherian scheme over a field $k$.
It is not always that case that $X_{k'}$ is locally Noetherian too.
For example if $X = \text{Spec}(\overline{\mathbf{Q}})$ and
$k = \mathbf{Q}$, then $X_{\overline{\mathbf{Q}}}$ is the spectrum
of $\overline{\mathbf{Q}} \otimes_{\mathbf{Q}} \overline{\mathbf{Q}}$
which is not Noetherian. (Hint: It has too many idempotents).
But if we only base change using finitely generated field extensions
then the Noetherian property is preserved. (Or if $X$ is locally of finite
type over $k$, since this proprety is preserved under base change.)

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-locally-Noetherian-base-change}
Let $k$ be a field.
Let $X$ be a scheme over $k$.
Let $k \subset k'$ be a finitely generated field extension.
Then $X$ is locally Noetherian if and only if $X_{k'}$ is locally
Noetherian.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Using Properties, Lemma \ref{properties-lemma-locally-Noetherian}
we reduce to the case where $X$ is
affine, say $X = \text{Spec}(A)$. In this case we have to prove that
$A$ is Noetherian if and only if $A_{k'}$ is Noetherian.
Since $A \to A_{k'} = k' \otimes_k A$ is faithfully flat, we see
that if $A_{k'}$ is Noetherian, then so is $A$, by
Algebra, Lemma \ref{algebra-lemma-descent-Noetherian}.
Conversely, suppose that $A$ is Noetherian. Write $k' = S^{-1}B$
where $B$ is a finite type $k$-algebra, and $S \subset B$ is a
multiplicative subset. Then we have $A_{k'} = S^{-1}(B \otimes_k A)$.
Hence $A_{k'}$ is a localization of the finite type $A$-algebra
$B \otimes_k A$ which is Noetherian (see
Algebra, Lemma \ref{algebra-lemma-Noetherian-permanence}).
\end{proof}







\section{Geometrically regular schemes}
\label{section-geometrically-regular}

\noindent
A geometrically regular scheme over a field $k$ is a locally Noetherian
scheme over $k$ which remains regular upon suitable changes of base field.
A finite type scheme over $k$ is geometrically regular if and only
if it is smooth over $k$ (see Lemma \ref{lemma-geometrically-regular-smooth}).
The notion of geometric regularity is most interesting in situations
where smoothness cannot be used such as formal fibres (insert future
reference here).

\medskip\noindent
In the following definition we restrict ourselves to locally Noetherian
schemes, since the property of being a regular local ring is only
defined for Noetherian local rings. By Lemma \ref{lemma-geometrically-normal}
above, if we restrict ourselves to finitely generated field extensions then
this property is preserved under change of base field. This comment will be
used without further reference in this section. In particular the following
definition makes sense.

\begin{definition}
\label{definition-geometrically-regular}
Let $k$ be a field. Let $X$ be a locally Noetherian scheme over $k$.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Let $x \in X$. We say $X$ is {\it geometrically regular at $x$}
over $k$ if for every finitely generated field extension $k \subset k'$
and any $x' \in X_{k'}$ lying over $x$ the local ring
$\mathcal{O}_{X_{k'}, x'}$ is regular.
\item We say $X$ is {\it geometrically regular over $k$} if
$X$ is geometrically regular at all of its points.
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

\noindent
A similar definition works to define geometrically
Cohen-Macaulay, $(R_k)$, and $(S_k)$ schemes over a field.
We will add a section for these separately as needed.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-geometrically-regular-at-point}
Let $k$ be a field.
Let $X$ be a locally Noetherian scheme over $k$.
Let $x \in X$.
The following are equivalent
\begin{enumerate}
\item $X$ is geometrically regular at $x$, and
\item the ring $\mathcal{O}_{X, x}$ is geometrically
regular over $k$ (see
Algebra, Definition \ref{algebra-definition-geometrically-regular}).
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Assume (1). This in particular implies that $\mathcal{O}_{X, x}$
is a regular local ring. Let $k \subset k'$ be a finite purely inseparable
field extension. Consider the ring $\mathcal{O}_{X, x} \otimes_k k'$.
By Algebra, Lemma \ref{algebra-lemma-p-ring-map}
its spectrum is the same as the spectrum of $\mathcal{O}_{X, x}$.
Hence it is a local ring also
(Algebra, Lemma \ref{algebra-lemma-characterize-local-ring}).
Therefore there is a unique point $x' \in X_{k'}$ lying over $x$
and $\mathcal{O}_{X_{k'}, x'} \cong \mathcal{O}_{X, x} \otimes_k k'$.
By assumption this is a regular ring. Hence we deduce (2)
from the definition of a geometrically regular ring.

\medskip\noindent
Assume (2). Let $k \subset k'$ be a field extension. Since
$\text{Spec}(k') \to \text{Spec}(k)$ is surjective, also
$X_{k'} \to X$ is surjective
(Morphisms, Lemma \ref{morphisms-lemma-base-change-surjective}).
Let $x' \in X_{k'}$ be any point lying over $x$.
The local ring $\mathcal{O}_{X_{k'}, x'}$
is a localization of the ring $\mathcal{O}_{X, x} \otimes_k k'$.
Hence it is regular by assumption and (1) is proved.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-geometrically-regular}
Let $k$ be a field.
Let $X$ be a locally Noetherian scheme over $k$.
The following are equivalent
\begin{enumerate}
\item $X$ is geometrically regular,
\item $X_{k'}$ is a regular scheme for every finitely generated field
extension $k \subset k'$,
\item $X_{k'}$ is a regular scheme for every finite purely inseparable
field extension $k \subset k'$, and
\item for every affine open $U \subset X$ the ring $\mathcal{O}_X(U)$
is geometrically regular (see
Algebra, Definition \ref{algebra-definition-geometrically-reduced}).
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Assume (1). Then for every finitely generated field extension
$k \subset k'$ and
every point $x' \in X_{k'}$ the local ring of $X_{k'}$ at $x'$
is regular. By Properties, Lemma \ref{properties-lemma-characterize-regular}
this means that $X_{k'}$ is regular. Hence (2).

\medskip\noindent
It is clear that (2) implies (3).

\medskip\noindent
Assume (3) and let $U \subset X$ be an affine open subscheme.
Then $U_{k'}$ is a regular scheme for any finite purely inseparable
extension $k \subset k'$ (including $k = k'$). This means that
$k' \otimes_k \mathcal{O}(U)$ is a regular ring for all
finite purely inseparable extensions $k \subset k'$. Hence
$\mathcal{O}(U)$ is a geometrically regular $k$-algebra by definition.

\medskip\noindent
Assume (5). For any field extension $k \subset k'$ the base
change $X_{k'}$ is gotten by gluing the spectra of the
rings $\mathcal{O}_X(U) \otimes_k k'$ where $U$ is affine open
in $X$ (see Schemes, Section \ref{schemes-section-fibre-products}).
Hence $X_{k'}$ is regular. So (1) holds.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-geometrically-regular-smooth}
Let $k$ be a field.
Let $X$ be a scheme of finite type over $k$.
Let $x \in X$.
Then $X$ is geometrically regular at $x$ if and only if $X \to \text{Spec}(k)$
is smooth at $x$ (Morphisms, Definition \ref{morphisms-definition-smooth}).
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
The question is local around $x$,
hence we may assume that $X = \text{Spec}(A)$
for some finite type $k$-algebra.
Let $x$ correspond to the prime $\mathfrak p$.

\medskip\noindent
If $A$ is smooth over $k$ at $\mathfrak p$, then we may localize $A$
and assume that $A$ is smooth over $k$. In this case $k' \otimes_k A$
is smooth over $k'$ for all extension fields $k'/k$, and each of
these Noetherian rings is regular by
Algebra, Lemma \ref{algebra-lemma-characterize-smooth-over-field}.

\medskip\noindent
Assume $X$ is geometrically regular at $x$.
Consider the residue field $K := \kappa(x) = \kappa(\mathfrak p)$ of $x$.
It is a finitely generated extension of $k$.
By Algebra, Lemma \ref{algebra-lemma-make-separable}
there exists a finite purely inseparable
extension $k \subset k'$ such that the compositum
$k'K$ is a separable field extension of $k'$.
Let $\mathfrak p' \subset A' = k' \otimes_k A$ be a prime ideal
lying over $\mathfrak p$. It is the unique prime lying over $\mathfrak p$, see
Algebra, Lemma \ref{algebra-lemma-p-ring-map}.
Hence the residue field $K' := \kappa(\mathfrak p')$
is the compositum $k'K$. By assumption the local ring
$(A')_{\mathfrak p'}$ is regular. Hence by
Algebra, Lemma \ref{algebra-lemma-separable-smooth}
we see that $k' \to A'$ is smooth at $\mathfrak p'$.
This in turn implies that $k \to A$ is smooth at $\mathfrak p$ by
Algebra, Lemma \ref{algebra-lemma-smooth-field-change-local}.
The lemma is proved.
\end{proof}

Let $k =\mathbf{F}_p(t)$. It is quite easy to give an example of a regular
variety $V$ over $k$ which is not geometrically reduced. For example we
can take $\text{Spec}(k[x]/(x^p - t))$. In fact, there exists an
example of a regular variety $V$ which is geometrically reduced, but
not even geometrically normal. Namely, take for $p > 2$ the scheme
$V = \text{Spec}(k[x, y]/(y^2 - x^p + t))$. This is a variety as the
polynomial $y^2 - x^p + t \in k[x, y]$ is irreducible.
The morphism $V \to \text{Spec}(k)$ is smooth at all points
except at the point $v_0 \in V$ corresponding to the maximal ideal
$(y, x^p - t)$ (because $2y$ is invertible). In particular we see that
$V$ is (geometrically) regular at all points, except possibly $v_0$.
The local ring
$$
\mathcal{O}_{V, v_0} = \left(k[x, y]/(y^2 - x^p + t)\right)_{(y, x^p - t)}
$$
is a domain of dimension $1$. Its maximal ideal is generated by $1$ element,
namely $x^p - t$. Hence it is a discrete valuation ring and regular.
Let $k' = k[t^{1/p}]$. Denote $t' = t^{1/p} \in k'$,
$V' = V_{k'}$, $v'_0 \in V'$ the unique point lying over $v_0$.
Over $k'$ we can write $x^p - t = (x - t')^p$, but the polynomial
$y^2 - (x - t')^p$ is still irreducible and $V'$ is still a variety.
But the element
$$
\frac{y}{x - t'} \in f.f.(\mathcal{O}_{V', v'_0})
$$
is integral over $\mathcal{O}_{V', v'_0}$ (just compute its square)
and not contained in it, so $V'$ is not normal at $v'_0$. This concludes
the example.
