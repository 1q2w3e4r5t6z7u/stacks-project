\section{Introduction}
\label{section-introduction}

\noindent
In this chapter we start studying varieties and more generally
schemes over a field. A fundamental reference is \cite{EGA}.








\section{Notation}
\label{section-notation}

\noindent
Throughout this chapter we use the letter $k$ to denote the ground field.










\section{Varieties}
\label{section-varieties}

\begin{definition}
\label{definition-variety}
Let $k$ be a field. A {\it variety} is scheme $X$ over $k$
such that $X$ is integral and the structural morphism
$X \to \text{Spec}(k)$ is separated and of finite type.
\end{definition}

\noindent
This definition has the following drawback. Suppose that
$k \subset k'$ is an extension of fields. Suppose that $X$
is a variety over $k$. Then the base change
$X_{k'} = X \times_{\text{Spec}(k)} \text{Spec}(k')$ is
not necessarily a variety over $k'$. This will be discussed
in some detail in the following sections.

\medskip\noindent
In fact, even the product of two varieties need not be a variety
(this is really the same phenomenon). Here is an example.

\begin{example}
\label{example-product-not-a-variety}
Let $k = \mathbf{Q}$. Let $X = \text{Spec}(\mathbf{Q}(i))$
and $Y = \text{Spec}(\mathbf{Q}(i))$. Then the product
$X \times_{\text{Spec}(k)} Y$ of the varieties $X$ and $Y$
is not a variety, since it is reducible. (It is isomorphic
to the disjoint union of two copies of $X$.)
\end{example}







\section{Geometrically reduced schemes}
\label{section-geometrically-reduced}

\noindent
If $X$ is a reduced scheme over a field, then it can happen that $X$
becomes nonreduced after extending the ground field. This does not happen
for geometrically reduced schemes.

\begin{definition}
\label{definition-geometrically-reduced}
Let $k$ be a field.
Let $X$ be a scheme over $k$.
Let $x \in X$ be a point.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Let $x \in X$ be a point.
We say $X$ is {\it geometrically reduced at $x$}
if for any field extension $k \subset k'$
and any point $x' \in X_{k'}$ lying over $x$
the local ring $\mathcal{O}_{X_{k'}, x'}$ is reduced.
\item We say $X$ is {\it geometrically irreducible} over $k$
if $X$ is geometrically reduced at every point of $X$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

\noindent
This may seem a little mysterious at first, but it is
really the same thing as the notion discussed in the algebra chapter.
Here are some basic results explaining the connection.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-geometrically-reduced-at-point}
Let $k$ be a field.
Let $X$ be a scheme over $k$.
Let $x \in X$.
The following are equivalent
\begin{enumerate}
\item $X$ is geometrically reduced at $x$, and
\item the ring $\mathcal{O}_{X, x}$ is geometrically
reduced over $k$ (see
Algebra, Definition \ref{algebra-definition-geometrically-reduced}).
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Assume (1). This in particular implies that $\mathcal{O}_{X, x}$
is reduced. Let $k \subset k'$ be a finite purely inseparable field
extension. Consider the ring $\mathcal{O}_{X, x} \otimes_k k'$.
By Algebra, Lemma \ref{algebra-lemma-p-ring-map}
its spectrum is the same as the spectrum of $\mathcal{O}_{X, x}$.
Hence it is a local ring also
(Algebra, Lemma \ref{algebra-lemma-characterize-local-ring}).
Therefore there is a unique point $x' \in X_{k'}$ lying over $x$
and $\mathcal{O}_{X_{k'}, x'} \cong \mathcal{O}_{X, x} \otimes_k k'$.
By assumption this is a reduced ring. Hence we deduce (2) by
Algebra, Lemma
\ref{algebra-lemma-geometrically-reduced-finite-purely-inseparable-extension}.

\medskip\noindent
Assume (2). Let $k \subset k'$ be a field extension. Since
$\text{Spec}(k') \to \text{Spec}(k)$ is surjective, also
$X_{k'} \to X$ is surjective
(Morphisms, Lemma \ref{morphisms-lemma-base-change-surjective}).
Let $x' \in X_{k'}$ be any point lying over $x$.
The local ring $\mathcal{O}_{X_{k'}, x'}$
is a localization of the ring $\mathcal{O}_{X, x} \otimes_k k'$.
Hence it is reduced by assumption and (1) is proved.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-geometrically-reduced}
Let $k$ be a field.
Let $X$ be a scheme over $k$.
The following are equivalent
\begin{enumerate}
\item $X$ is geometrically reduced,
\item for every field extension $k \subset k'$ the scheme $X_{k'}$
is reduced, and
\item for every affine open $U \subset X$ the ring $\mathcal{O}_X(U)$
is geometrically reduced (see
Algebra, Definition \ref{algebra-definition-geometrically-reduced}).
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Assume (1). Then for every field extension $k \subset k'$ and
every point $x' \in X_{k'}$ the local ring of $X_{k'}$ at $x'$
is reduced. In other words $X_{k'}$ is reduced. Hence (2).

\medskip\noindent
Assume (2). Let $U \subset X$ be an affine open. Then for
every field extension the scheme $X_{k'}$ is reduced, hence
$U_{k'} = \text{Spec}(\mathcal{O}(U)\otimes_k k')$ is reduced,
hence $\mathcal{O}(U)\otimes_k k'$ is reduced (see Properties,
Section \ref{properties-section-integral}). In other words
$\mathcal{O}(U)$ is geometrically reduced, so (3) holds.

\medskip\noindent
Assume (3). For any field extension $k \subset k'$ the base
change $X_{k'}$ is gotten by gluing the spectra of the
rings $\mathcal{O}_X(U) \otimes_k k'$ where $U$ is affine open
in $X$ (see Schemes, Section \ref{schemes-section-fibre-products}).
Hence $X_{k'}$ is reduced. So (1) holds.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-check-only-finite-inseparable-extensions}
Let $k$ be a field. Let $X$ be a scheme over $k$.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Let $x \in X$, and assume $\mathcal{O}_{X, x}$ reduced.
To check that $X$ is geometrically reduced at $x$ it suffices to check
$\mathcal{O}_{X_{k'}, x'}$ is reduced for every
finite purely inseparable field extension $k'$ of $k$ and
$x' \in X_{k'}$ over $x$.
\item Assume $X$ reduced.
To see that $X$ is geometrically reduced it suffices to check
$X_{k'}$ is reduced for every finite purely inseparable field
extension $k'/k$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
This follows from Lemmas \ref{lemma-geometrically-reduced-at-point}
and \ref{lemma-geometrically-reduced} above and Algebra, Lemma
\ref{algebra-lemma-geometrically-reduced-finite-purely-inseparable-extension}.
Details omitted.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-perfect-reduced}
Let $X$ be a scheme over a perfect field $k$.
If $X$ is reduced, then $X$ is geometrically reduced over $k$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Follows immediately from
Lemma \ref{lemma-check-only-finite-inseparable-extensions}
and the definition of a perfect field
(Algebra, Definition \ref{algebra-definition-perfect}).
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-geometrically-reduced-any-base-change}
Let $k$ be a field.
Let $X$, $Y$ be schemes over $k$.
Assume $X$ geometrically reduced over $k$ and $Y$ reduced.
Then $X \times_k Y$ is reduced.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Combine, Lemma \ref{lemma-geometrically-reduced} and Algebra,
Lemma \ref{algebra-lemma-geometrically-reduced-any-reduced-base-change}.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-Noetherian-geometrically-reduced-at-point}
Let $k$ be a field.
Let $X$ be a scheme over $k$.
Let $x \in X$.
Assume $X$ locally Noetherian and geometrically reduced at $x$.
Then there exists an open neighbourhood $U \subset X$ of $x$
which is geometrically reduced over $k$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Let $R$ be a Noetherian $k$-algebra.
Let $\mathfrak p \subset R$ be a prime.
Let $I = \text{Ker}(R \to R_{\mathfrak p}$.
Since $IR_{\mathfrak p} = R_{\mathfrak p}$ and $I$ is finitely generated
there exists an $f \in R$, $f \not \in \mathfrak p$ such that $fI = 0$. 
Hence $R_f \subset R_{\mathfrak p}$.

\medskip\noindent
Assume $X$ locally Noetherian and geometrically reduced at $x$.
If we apply the above to $R = \mathcal{O}_X(U)$ for some affine
open neighbourhood of $x$, and $\mathfrak p \subset R$ the prime
corresponding to $x$, then we see that after shrinking $U$ we may
assume $R \subset R_{\mathfrak p}$. By
Lemma \ref{lemma-geometrically-reduced-at-point} the assumption
means that $R_{\mathfrak p}$ is geometrically reduced over $k$.
By Algebra, Lemma \ref{algebra-lemma-subalgebra-separable}
this implies that $R$ is geometrically reduced over $k$, which
in turn implies that $U$ is goemetrically reduced.
\end{proof}

\begin{example}
\label{example-not-geometrically-reduced}
Let $k = \mathbf{F}_p(s, t)$, i.e., a purely transcendental extension
of the prime field. Consider the variety
$X = \text{Spec}(k[x, y]/(1 + sx^p + ty^p))$.
Let $k \subset k'$ be any extension such that
both $s$ and $t$ have a $p$th root in $k'$.
Then the base change $X_{k'}$ is not reduced.
Namely, the ring $k'[x, y]/(1 + s x^p + ty^p)$ contains the element
$1 + s^{1/p}x + t^{1/p}y$ whose $p$th power is zero but
which is not zero (since the ideal $(1 + sx^p + ty^p)$ certainly
does not contain any nonzero element of degree $< p$).
\end{example}






\section{Geometrically connected schemes}
\label{section-geometrically-connected}

\noindent
If $X$ is a connected scheme over a field, then it can happen that $X$
becomes disconnected after extending the ground field. This does not happen
for geometrically connected schemes.

\begin{definition}
\label{definition-geometrically-connected}
Let $X$ be a scheme over the field $k$.
We say $X$ is {\it geometrically connected} over $k$
if the scheme $X_{k'}$ is connected\footnote{An empty scheme is connected.}
for every field extension $k'$ of $k$.
\end{definition}


\begin{example}
\label{example-not-geometrically-irreducible}
Let $k = \mathbf{Q}$. By our definition above the scheme
$X = \text{Spec}(\mathbf{Q}(i))$ is a variety over $\text{Spec}(\mathbf{Q})$.
But the base change $X_{\mathbf{C}}$ is the spectrum of
$\mathbf{C} \otimes_{\mathbf{Q}} \mathbf{Q}(i) \cong
\mathbf{C} \times \mathbf{C}$ which is the disjoint union of
two copies of $\text{Spec}(\mathbf{C})$. So in fact, this is an
example of a non-geometrically connected variety.
\end{example}


\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-separably-closed-field-connected-components}
Let $k \subset k'$ be an extension of fields.
Let $X$ be a scheme over $k$. Set $X' = X_{k'}$.
Assume $k$ separably algebraically closed.
Then the morphism $X' \to X$ induces a bijection of connected
components.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}

\end{proof}



\section{Geometrically irreducible schemes}
\label{section-geometrically-irreducible}

\noindent
If $X$ is an irreducible scheme over a field, then it can happen that $X$
becomes reducible after extending the ground field. This does not happen
for geometrically irreducible schemes.

\begin{definition}
\label{definition-geometrically-irreducible}
Let $X$ be a scheme over the field $k$.
We say $X$ is {\it geometrically irreducible} over $k$
if the scheme $X_{k'}$ is irreducible for any field extension $k'$
of $k$.
\end{definition}



\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-separably-closed-irreducible}
Let $X$ be a scheme over a separably closed field $k$.
If $X$ is irreducible, then $X_K$ is irreducible for any
field extension $k \subset K$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Use Properties, Lemma \ref{properties-lemma-characterize-irreducible}
and Algebra, Lemma \ref{algebra-lemma-separably-closed-irreducible}.
\end{proof}







\section{Geometrically integral schemes}
\label{section-geometrically-integral}

\noindent
If $X$ is an irreducible scheme over a field, then it can happen that $X$
becomes reducible after extending the ground field. This does not happen
for geometrically irreducible schemes.

\begin{definition}
\label{definition-geometrically-integral}
Let $X$ be a scheme over the field $k$.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Let $x \in X$. We say $X$ is
{\it geometrically pointwise integral at $x$} if for every
field extension $k \subset k'$ and every $x' \in X_{k'}$ lying over $x$
the local ring $\mathcal{O}_{X_{k'}, x'}$ is integral.
\item We say $X$ is {\it geometrically pointwise integral} if $X$
is geometrically pointwise integral at every point.
\item We say $X$ is {\it geometrically integral} over $k$ if the scheme
$X_{k'}$ is integral for every field extension $k'$ of $k$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

\noindent
The distinction between notions (2) and (3) is necessary.
For example if $k = \mathbf{R}$ and $X = \text{Spec}(\mathbf{C}[x])$,
then $X$ is geometrically pointwise integral over $\mathbf{R}$ but
of course not geometrically integral.
