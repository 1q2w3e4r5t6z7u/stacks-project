\section{Introduction}
\label{section-introduction}

\noindent
Hypercoverings can be used to compute cohomology of abelian sheaves on sites
without recourse to injective resolutions. See \cite[Expose V, Sec. 7]{SGA4}.
A nice manuscript on cohomological descent is the text by Brian Conrad,
see \url{http://www.math.lsa.umich.edu/~bdconrad/papers/hypercover.pdf}.
Probably it is useless to try to improve on Brian's article, so we look
at the question a little differently (more naively).

\section{The category $\Delta$}
\label{section-Delta}

\noindent
The category $\Delta$ is the category with
\begin{enumerate}
\item objects $[0], [1], [2], \ldots$ with
$[n] = \{0, 1, 2, \ldots, n\}$ and
\item morphism $[n] \to [m]$ is the set of nondecreasing
maps of sets $\{0, 1, 2, \ldots, n\} \to \{0, 1, 2, \ldots, m\}$.
\end{enumerate}
Here {\it nondecreasing} for a map $\varphi : [n] \to [m]$
means by definition that $\varphi(i) \geq \varphi(j)$ if $i \geq j$.
In other words, $\Delta$ is a category equivalent to the
``big'' category of finite totally ordered sets and nondecreasing maps.
There are exactly $n + 1$ morphisms $[0] \to [n]$ and
there is exactly $1$ morphism $[n] \to [0]$. There are
exactly $(n + 1)(n + 2)/2$ morphisms $[1] \to [n]$ and there are
exactly $n + 2$ morphisms $[n] \to [1]$. And so on and so forth.

\begin{definition}
\label{definition-face-degeneracy}
For any integer $n\geq 1$, and any $0\leq j \leq n$ we let $\delta^n_j : [n-1]
\to [n]$ denote the injective order preserving map skipping $j$. For any
integer $n\geq 0$, and any $0\leq j \leq n$ we denote $\sigma^n_j : [n+1] 
\to [n]$ the surjective order preserving map with 
$(\sigma^n_j)^{-1}(\{j\}) = \{j, j+1\}$.
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-face-degeneracy}
Any morphism in $\Delta$ can be written as a composition
of an identity morphism, and the morphisms $\delta^n_j$ and $\sigma^n_j$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Let $\varphi : [n] \to [m]$ be a morphism of $\Delta$.
If $j \not \in \text{Im}(\varphi)$, then we can write
$\varphi$ as $\delta^m_j \circ \psi$ for some morphism
$\psi : [n] \to [m - 1]$. If $\varphi(j) = \varphi(j + 1)$
then we can write $\varphi$ as $\psi \circ \sigma^{n - 1}_j$
for some morphism $\psi : [n - 1] \to [m]$.
The result follows because each replacement
as above lowers $n + m$ and hence at some point
$\varphi$ is both injective and surjective, hence
an identity morphism.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-relations-face-degeneracy}
The morphisms $\delta^n_j$ and $\sigma^n_j$ satisfy the following relations.
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\delta^{n + 1}_i \circ \delta^n_j =
\delta^{n + 1}_j \circ \delta^n_{i - 1}$
for $0 \leq j < i \leq n + 1$.
In other words the diagram
$$
\xymatrix{
& [n] \ar[rd]^{\delta^{n + 1}_i} & \\
[n - 1] \ar[ru]^{\delta^n_j} \ar[rd]_{\delta^n_{i - 1}} & &
[n + 1] \\
& [n] \ar[ru]_{\delta^{n + 1}_j} & 
}
$$
commutes.
\item $\sigma^{n - 1}_i \circ \delta^n_j =
\delta^{n - 1}_{j - 1} \circ \sigma^{n - 2}_i$
for $0 < i + 1 < j \leq n$.
In other words the diagram
$$
\xymatrix{
& [n] \ar[rd]^{\sigma^{n - 1}_i} & \\
[n - 1] \ar[ru]^{\delta^n_j} \ar[rd]_{\sigma^{n - 2}_i} & &
[n - 1] \\
& [n - 2] \ar[ru]_{\delta^{n - 1}_{j - 1}} & 
}
$$
commutes.
\item $\sigma^{n - 1}_j \circ \delta^n_j =
\text{id}_{[n - 1]}$
for $0 \leq j \leq n - 1$.
In other words the diagram
$$
\xymatrix{
& [n] \ar[rd]^{\sigma^{n - 1}_j} & \\
[n - 1] \ar[ru]^{\delta^n_j} \ar[rr]^{\text{id}_{[n - 1]}} & & [n - 1]
}
$$
commutes.
\item $\sigma^{n - 1}_{j - 1} \circ \delta^n_j =
\text{id}_{[n - 1]}$
for $1 \leq j \leq n$.
In other words the diagram
$$
\xymatrix{
& [n] \ar[rd]^{\sigma^{n - 1}_{j - 1}} & \\
[n - 1] \ar[ru]^{\delta^n_j} \ar[rr]_{\text{id}_{[n - 1]}} & & [n - 1]}
$$
commutes.
\item $\sigma^{n - 1}_i \circ \delta^n_j =
\delta^{n - 1}_j \circ \sigma^{n - 2}_{i + 1}$
for $i > j \geq 0$.
In other words the diagram
$$
\xymatrix{
& [n] \ar[rd]^{\sigma^{n - 1}_i} & \\
[n - 1] \ar[ru]^{\delta^n_j} \ar[rd]_{\sigma^{n - 2}_{i + 1}} & &
[n - 1] \\
& [n - 2] \ar[ru]_{\delta^{n - 1}_j} & 
}
$$
commutes.
\item $\sigma^{n - 1}_i \circ \sigma^n_j =
\sigma^{n - 1}_{j - 1} \circ \sigma^n_i$
for $0 \leq i < j \leq n$.
In other words the diagram
$$
\xymatrix{
& [n] \ar[rd]^{\sigma^{n - 1}_i} & \\
[n + 1] \ar[ru]^{\sigma^n_j} \ar[rd]_{\sigma^n_i} & &
[n - 1] \\
& [n] \ar[ru]_{\sigma^{n - 1}_{j - 1}} & 
}
$$
commutes.
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Omitted.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-face-degeneracy-category}
The category $\Delta$ is the universal category
with objects $[n]$, $n \geq 0$ and morphisms
$\delta^n_j$ and $\sigma^n_j$ such that (a) every morphism is
a composition of these morphisms, (b) the relations
listed in Lemma \ref{lemma-relations-face-degeneracy} are satisfied,
and (c) any relation among the morphisms is a consquence of
those relations.
\end{lemma}







\section{Simplicial objects}
\label{section-simplicial-object}

\begin{definition}
\label{definition-simplicial-object}
Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a category.
\begin{enumerate}
\item A {\it simplicial object $U$ of $\mathcal{C}$}
is a contravariant functor $U$ from $\Delta$ to
$\mathcal{C}$, in a formula:
$$
U : \Delta^{opp} \longrightarrow \mathcal{C}
$$
\item If $\mathcal{C}$ is the category of sets, then we call
$U$ a {\it simplicial set}.
\item If $\mathcal{C}$ is the category of abelian groups,
then we call $U$ a {\it simplicial abelian group}.
\item A {\it morphism of simplicial objects $U \to U'$}
is a transformation of functors.
\item The {\it category of simplicial objects of $\mathcal{C}$}
is denoted $\text{Simp}(\mathcal{C})$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

\noindent
This means there are objects $U([0]), U([1]), U([2]), \ldots$
and morphisms $U(\varphi) : U([n]) \to U([m])$,
where $\varphi$ is any nondecreasing map $\varphi : [m] \to [n]$. 

\medskip\noindent
In particular there is a unique morphism $U([0]) \to U([n])$ and there are
exactly $n + 1$ morphisms $U([n]) \to U([0])$ corresponding to
the $n + 1$ maps $[0] \to [n]$. Obviously we need some more notation
to be able to talk 
intelligently about these simplicial objects. We do this by considering
the morphisms we singled out in Section \ref{section-Delta} above.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-characterize-simplicial-object}
Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a category.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Given a simplicial object $U$ in $\mathcal{C}$
we obtain a sequence of objects $U_n = U([n])$ endowed
with the morphisms $d^n_j = U(\delta^n_j) : U_n \to U_{n-1}$ and
$s^n_j = U(\sigma^n_j) : U_n \to U_{n + 1}$. These morphisms
satisfy the opposites of the relations displayed in
Lemma \ref{lemma-relations-face-degeneracy}.
\item Conversely, given a sequence of objects $U_n$ and morphisms
$d^n_j$, $s^n_j$ satisfying these relations there exists a unique
a simplicial object $U$ in $\mathcal{C}$ such that $U_n = U([n])$,
$d^n_j = U(\delta^n_j)$, and $s^n_j = U(\sigma^n_j)$.
\item A morphism between simplicial objects $U$ and $U'$
is given by a family of morphisms $U_n \to U'_n$ commuting
with the morphisms $d^n_j$ and $s^n_j$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
This follows from Lemma \ref{lemma-face-degeneracy-category}.
\end{proof}

\noindent
We get a unique morphism $s^0_0 = U(\sigma^0_0) : U_0 \to U_1$ and
two morphisms $d^1_0 = U(\delta^1_0)$, and
$d^1_1 = U(\delta^1_1)$ which are morphisms $U_1 \to U_0$.
There are two morphisms $s^1_0 = U(\sigma^1_0)$, $s^1_1 = U(\sigma^1_1)$
which are morphsms $U_1 \to U_2$. Three morphisms
$d^2_0 = U(\delta^2_0)$, $d^2_1 = U(\delta^2_1)$, $d^2_2 = U(\delta^2_2)$
which are morphisms $U_3 \to U_2$. And so on.

\medskip\noindent
Pictorially we think of $U$ as follows:
$$
\xymatrix{
U_2
\ar@<2ex>[r]
\ar@<0ex>[r]
\ar@<-2ex>[r]
&
U_1 
\ar@<1ex>[r]
\ar@<-1ex>[r]
\ar@<1ex>[l]
\ar@<-1ex>[l]
&
U_0
\ar@<0ex>[l]
}
$$
Here the $d$-morphisms are the arrows pointing right and the 
$s$-morphisms are the arrows pointing left.

\begin{example}
\label{example-constant-simplicial-object}
The simplest example is the {\it constant} simplicial object with
value $X \in \text{Ob}(\mathcal{C})$. In other words, $U_n=X$ and
all maps are $\text{id}_X$.
\end{example}

\begin{example}
\label{example-fibre-products-simplicial-object}
Suppose that $Y\to X$ is a morphism of $C$ such that all
the fibred products $Y\times_X Y \times_X \ldots \times_X Y$ exist.
Then we set $U_n$ equal to the $(n + 1)$-fold fibre product,
and we let $\varphi: [n] \to [m]$ correspond to the map
(on ``coordinates'')
$(y_0,\ldots, y_m) \mapsto (y_{\varphi(0)},\ldots, y_{\varphi(n)})$.
In other words, the map $U_0 = Y \to U_1 = Y\times_X Y$ is the
diagonal map. The two maps $U_1 = Y\times_X Y \to U_0 = Y$ are the
projection maps.
\end{example}

\noindent
Geometrically Example \ref{example-fibre-products-simplicial-object}
above is an important example. It tells us that it is a good
idea to think of the maps $d^n_j : U_{n + 1} \to U_n$
as projection maps (forgetting the $j$th component),
and to think of the maps $s^n_j : U_n \to U_{n + 1}$
as diagonal maps (repeating the $j$th coordinate).
We will return to this in the next section.

\medskip\noindent
Another observation is that we may think of a simplicial
object of $\mathcal{C}$ as a presheaf with values in $\mathcal{C}$
over $\Delta$. See
Sites, Definition \ref{sites-definition-presheaf}.
And in fact, if $U$, $U'$ are simplicial objects
of $\mathcal{C}$, then we have
\begin{equation}
\label{simplicial-set-presheaf}
\text{Mor}(U, U') = \text{Mor}_{\textit{PSh}(\Delta)}(U, U').
\end{equation}


\section{Simplicial sets}
\label{section-simplicial-set}

\noindent
Let $U$ be a simplical set. It is a good idea to think of
$U_0$ as the {\it $0$-simplices}, the set $U_1$ as the
{\it $1$-simplices},
the set $U_2$ as the {\it $2$-simplices}, and so on.

\medskip\noindent
We think of the maps $s^n_j : U_n \to U_{n + 1}$ as
the map that associates to an $n$-simplex $A$ the degenerate
$(n + 1)$-simplex $B$ whose $(j, j + 1)$-edge is collapsed
to the vertex $j$ of $A$. We think of the map $d^n_j : U_n \to U_{n - 1}$
as the map that associates to an $n$-simplex $A$ one of the
faces, namely the face that omits the vertex $j$.
In this way it become possible to visualize the relations
among the maps $s^n_j$ and $d^n_j$ geometrically.

\begin{definition}
\label{definition-terminology-simplicial-sets}
Let $U$ be a simplicial set. 
We say {\it $x$ is a $n$-simplex of $U$} to signify that
$x$ is an element of $U_n$. We say that {\it $y$ is the $j$the
face of $x$} to signify that $d^n_jx = y$. We say that
{\it $z$ is the $j$th degeneracy of $x$} if $z = s^n_jx$.
A simplex is called {\it degenerate} if it is the degeneracy
of another simplex.
\end{definition}

\noindent
Here are a few fundamental examples.

\begin{example}
\label{example-simplex-simplicial-set}
For every $n \geq 0$ we denote $\Delta[n]$ the simplicial set
\begin{align*}
\Delta^{opp} & \longrightarrow \textit{Sets} \\
[k] & \longmapsto \text{Mor}_{\Delta}([k], [n])
\end{align*}
We leave it to the reader to verify the following statements.
Every $m$-simplex of $\Delta[n]$ with $m > n$ is degenerate.
There is a unique nondegenerate $n$-simplex of $\Delta[n]$,
namely $\text{id}_{[n]}$.
\end{example}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-simplex-map}
Let $U$ be a simplicial set. Let $n \geq 0$ be an integer.
There is a canonical bijection
$$
\text{Mor}(\Delta[n], U)
\longrightarrow
U_n
$$
which maps a morphism $\varphi$ to the value of $\varphi$
on the unique nondegenerate $n$-simplex of $\Delta[n]$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Omitted.
\end{proof}

\begin{example}
\label{example-simplex-category}
Consider the category $\Delta/[n]$ of objects over $[n]$
in $\Delta$, see
Categories, Example \ref{categories-example-comma-category}.
There is a functor $p : \Delta/[n] \to \Delta$.
The fibre category of $p$ over $[k]$, see
Categories, Section \ref{categories-section-fibred-groupoids},
has as objects the
set $\Delta[n]_k$ of $k$-simplices in $\Delta[n]$, and as
morphisms only identities. For every morphism
$\varphi : [k] \to [l]$ of $\Delta$, and every object $\psi : [l] \to [n]$
in the fibre category over $[l]$ there is a unique
object over $[k]$ with a morphism covering $\varphi$, namely
$\psi \circ \varphi : [k] \to [n]$. Thus $\Delta/[n]$
is fibred in sets over $\Delta$. In other words, we may
think of $\Delta/[n]$ as a presheaf of sets over $\Delta$.
See also, Categories,
Example \ref{categories-example-fibred-category-from-functor-of-points}.
And this presheaf of sets agrees with the simplicial set
$\Delta[n]$. In particular, from Equation
(\ref{simplicial-set-presheaf}) and 
Lemma \ref{lemma-simplex-map} above
we get the formula
$$
\text{Mor}_{\textit{PSh}(\Delta)}(\Delta/[n], U) = U_n
$$
for any simplicial set $U$.
\end{example}


\section{Skelet and coskelet functors}
\label{section-skelet}

\noindent
Let $\Delta_{\leq n}$ denote the full subcategory of
$\Delta$ with objects $[0], [1], [2], \ldots, [n]$.
Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a category.
An {\it $n$-truncated simplicial object of $\mathcal{C}$} 
is a contravariant functor from $\Delta_{\leq n}$ to
$\mathcal{C}$.
We denote the category of $n$-truncated
simplicial objects of $\mathcal{C}$ by
the symbol $\text{Simp}_n(\mathcal{C})$.

\medskip\noindent
Given a simplicial object $U$ of $\mathcal{C}$
the truncation $\text{sk}_n U$ is the restriction
of $U$ to the subcategory $\Delta_{\leq n}$.
This defines a {\it skelet functor}
$$
\text{sk}_n :
\text{Simp}(\mathcal{C}) \longrightarrow \text{Simp}_n(\mathcal{C})
$$
from the category of simplicial objects of $\mathcal{C}$
to the category of $n$-truncated simplicial objects of $\mathcal{C}$.

\medskip\noindent
The {\it coskelet functor} (if it exists) is a functor
$$
\text{cosk}_n :
\text{Simp}(\mathcal{C}) \longrightarrow \text{Simp}_n(\mathcal{C})
$$
which is right adjoint to the skelet functor. In a formula
$$
\text{Mor}_{\text{Simp}(\mathcal{C})}(U, \text{cosk}_n V)
=
\text{Mor}_{\text{Simp}_n(\mathcal{C})}(\text{sk}_n U, V)
$$
Given a $n$-truncated simplicial object we 
say that {\it $\text{cosk}_nV$ exists} if there
exists an object $\text{cosk}_nV \in \text{Simp}(\mathcal{C})$
such that the formula above is valid. If it exists it
is unique up to unique isomorphism by the Yoneda lemma.
See Categories, Section \ref{categories-section-opposite}.

\medskip\noindent
Recall the category $\Delta/[n]$, see Example \ref{example-simplex-category}.
We let $(\Delta/[n])_{\leq m}$ denote the full subcategory
of $\Delta/[n]$ consisting of objects $[k] \to [n]$
of $\Delta/[n]$ with $k \leq m$. In other words we have
the following commutative diagram of categories and functors
$$
\xymatrix{
(\Delta/[n])_{\leq m} \ar[r] \ar[d] &
\Delta/[n] \ar[d] \\
\Delta_{\leq m} \ar[r] &
\Delta
}
$$
Given a $m$-truncated
simplicial object $U$ of $\mathcal{C}$
we define a functor
$$
U(n) : (\Delta/[n])_{\leq m}^{opp} \longrightarrow \mathcal{C}
$$
by the rules
\begin{eqnarray*}
([k] \to [n]) & \longmapsto & U_k \\
(\psi : ([k] \to [n]) \to ([k'] \to [n])) &
\longmapsto &
U(\psi) : U_{k'} \to U_k
\end{eqnarray*}
For a given morphism $\varphi : [n] \to [n']$ of $\Delta$
we have an associated functor
$$
"\varphi" : (\Delta/[n])_{\leq m} \longrightarrow (\Delta/[n'])_{\leq m}
$$
which maps $\alpha : [k] \to [n]$ to
$\varphi \circ \alpha : [k] \to [n']$.
The composition $U(n') \circ "\varphi"$ is
equal to the functor $U(n)$.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-existence-cosk}
If the category $\mathcal{C}$ has finite limits, then
$\text{cosk}_m$ functors exist for all $m$. Moreover,
for any $m$-truncated simplicial object $U$ the
simplicial object $\text{cosk}_mU$ is described
by the formula
$$
(\text{cosk}_mU)_n = \text{lim}_{(\Delta/[n])_{\leq m}^{opp}}\ U(n)
$$
and for $\varphi : [n] \to [n']$ the map
$\text{cosk}_mU(\varphi)$ comes from the
identification $U(n') \circ "\varphi" = U(n)$ above 
via Categories, Lemma \ref{categories-lemma-functorial-limit}.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Suppose that $V$ is a simplicial object.
A morphism $\gamma : V \to \text{cosk}_mU$ is given by a sequence
of morphisms $\gamma_n : V_n \to (\text{cosk}_mU)_n$.
By definition of a limit, this is given by a
collection of morphisms $\gamma(\alpha) : V_n \to U_k$
where $\alpha$ ranges over all $\alpha : [k] \to [n]$
with $k \leq m$. These morphisms then also satisfy
the rules that
$$
\xymatrix{
V_n \ar[r]_{\gamma(\alpha)} &  U_k \\
V_{n'} \ar[r]^{\gamma(\alpha')} \ar[u]^{V(\varphi)} & U_{k'} \ar[u]_{U(\psi)}
}
$$
are commutative, where $\psi : [k] \to [k']$,
$\varphi : [n] \to [n']$, $\alpha : [k] \to [n]$ and
$\alpha' : [k'] \to [n']$ are any morphisms of $\Delta$
such that $\varphi \circ \alpha = \alpha' \circ \psi$.
Taking $n = k$, $\varphi = \alpha'$, and $\alpha = \psi = \text{id}_{[k]}$
we deduce that $\gamma(\alpha') = \gamma(\text{id}_{[k]}) \circ V(\alpha')$.
In other words, the morphisms $\gamma(\text{id}_{[k]})$, $k \leq m$
determine the morphism $\gamma$. And it is easy to see that these
morphisms form a morphism $\text{sk}_m V \to U$.

\medskip\noindent
Conversely, given a morphism $\gamma : \text{sk}_n V \to U$, 
we obtain a family of morphsms $\gamma(\alpha)$
where $\alpha$ ranges over all $\alpha : [k] \to [n]$
with $k \leq m$ by setting $\gamma(\alpha) = 
\gamma(\text{id}_{[k]}) \circ V(\alpha)$. These morphisms
satisfy all the displayed commutativity restraints pictured
above, and hence give rise to a morphism $V \to \text{cosk}_m U$.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-trivial-cosk}
Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a category.
Let $U$ be an $m$-truncated simplicial object of $\mathcal{C}$.
For $n \leq m$ the limit $\text{lim}_{(\Delta/[n])_{\leq m}^{opp}}\ U(n)$
exists and is canonically isomorphic to $U_n$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
This is true because the category $(\Delta/[n])_{\leq m}$
has an final object in this case, namely the identity
map $[n] \to [n]$.
\end{proof}

\noindent
Let us describe the coskelet functor in more detail.
By abuse of notation we will denote $\text{sk}_n$
also the restriction functor
$\text{Simp}_{n'}(\mathcal{C}) \to \text{Simp}_{n'}(\mathcal{C})$
for any $n' \geq n$. We will denote a right adjoint
of this functor abusively by $\text{sk}_{n'}\text{cosk}_n$
if it exists.
For $n \geq 1$, $0 \leq i < j \leq n + 1$
define $\delta^{n + 1}_{i,j} : [n - 1] \to [n + 1]$
to be the increasing map omitting $i$ and $j$.
Note that
$\delta^{n + 1}_{i,j} =
\delta^{n + 1}_j \circ \delta^n_i =
\delta^{n + 1}_i \circ \delta^n_{j - 1}$, see
Lemma \ref{lemma-relations-face-degeneracy}. This motivates
the following lemma.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-work-out}
Let $n$ be an integer $\geq 2$. Let $U$ be a $n$-truncated
simplicial object of $\mathcal{C}$. Consider the
contravariant functor from $\mathcal{C}$ to $\textit{Sets}$
which associates to an object $T$ the set
$$
\{ (f_0,\ldots,f_{n + 1}) \in \text{Mor}_{\mathcal{C}}(T, U_n)
\mid
d^n_{j - 1} \circ f_i = d^n_i \circ f_j\ 
\forall\ 0\leq i < j\leq n + 1\}
$$
If this functor is representable, then there exists an
$(n + 1)$-truncated simplicial object
$\text{sk}_{n + 1}\text{cosk}_n U$ such that the following
adjointness holds
$$
\text{Mor}_{\text{Simp}_{n + 1}(\mathcal{C})}(V,
\text{sk}_{n + 1}\text{cosk}_n U)
=
\text{Mor}_{\text{Simp}_n(\mathcal{C})}(\text{sk}_nV, U)
$$
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Denote the representing object $U_{n + 1}$. Denote the maps
$U_{n + 1} \to U_n$, given on functors as
$(f_0,\ldots,f_{n + 1}) \mapsto f_i$ by
$d^{n + 1}_i$. Consider the $(n + 1)$-truncated
simplicial object $\tilde U$ given by $U_0, \ldots, U_n, U_{n + 1}$, and
maps defined as follows. For $\varphi : [k] \to [l]$, $k,l \leq n$
use the morphisms $U(\varphi) : U_l \to U_k$.
For $\varphi : [k] \to [n + 1]$ with $k \leq n$ choose
an $i$ not in the image of $\varphi$ and write
$\varphi = \delta^{n + 1}_i \circ \varphi'$. In this case take
the morphism $U_{n + 1} \to U_n \to U_k$ which is
the composition of $d^{n + 1}_i$ and $U(\varphi')$.
For $\varphi : [n + 1] \to [k]$ consider the maps
$\varphi \circ \delta^{n + 1}_i : [n] \to [k]$ which
give morphisms $f_i = U(\varphi \circ \delta^n_i) : U_k \to U_{n - 1}$.
If we check these satisfy the relations in the definition
of $U_{n + 1}$ then we obtain the desired morphism $U_k \to U_{n + 1}$.
To see this it suffices to check that
$$
\varphi \circ \delta^{n + 1}_i \circ \delta^n_{j - 1}
=
\varphi \circ \delta^{n + 1}_j \circ \delta^n_i
$$
which is true by the discussion above the lemma.
Finally, given a map $\varphi : [n + 1] \to [n + 1]$
if it is not the identity then we can factor it
as $[n + 1] \to [n] \to [n + 1]$ and use the definitions
above.

\medskip\noindent
We leave it to the reader to verify that this indeed
defines a contravariant functor $\Delta_{\leq n + 1}$.
Alternatively, the reader may verify that the object $U_{n + 1}$
defined above represents the limit
$\text{lim}_{(\Delta/[n + 1])_{\leq n}^{opp}}\ U(n)$,
and use this in combination with Lemma \ref{lemma-trivial-cosk} to define
the maps above.

\medskip\noindent
To see the adjointness we argue that any element
$\gamma$ of the right hand side of the formula
gives rise to a unique morphism $V_{n + 1} \to U_{n + 1}$
corresponding to setting $f_i : V_{n+1} \to U_n$
equal to the morphism $\gamma_n \circ d^{n+1} : V_{n+1} \to V_n \to U_n$.
Conversely, given a morphsm $\gamma'$ of the left hand side
we can simply restrict to $\Delta_{\leq n}$ to get an element
of the right hand side.
Details left to the reader, see also
Remark \ref{remark-cosk-simplicial-sets}.
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}
\label{remark-cosk-simplicial-sets}
The construction of Lemma \ref{lemma-work-out}
above in the case of simplicial
sets is the following. Given an $n$-truncated simplicial
set $U$, we make a canonical $(n + 1)$-truncated simplicial
set as follows. We add a set of $(n + 1)$-simplices
$U_{n + 1}$ by the formula of the lemma. This means that
an element of $U_{n + 1}$ is a numbered collection of
$n + 2$ faces $(f_0,\ldots,f_n)$, with the property that they glue
as they would in a $(n + 1)$-simplex. In other words,
the $i$th face of $f_j$ is the $(j-1)$st face of $f_i$
for $i < j$. If $V$ is an $(n + 1)$-truncated simplicial set,
then its $(n + 1)$-simplices give rise to compatible collections
of faces

\section{Hypercoverings}

\noindent
Assume that $\mathcal{C}$ is a site with the property
that the set of coverings consisting of $1$ morphism is cofinal.
Let $\mathcal{F}$ be a sheaf of abelian groups on
the site $\mathcal{C}$ which is assumed to have the property
that the set of coverings consisting of $1$ morphism is cofinal.
Choose an injective resolution $\mathcal{F} \to \mathcal{J}^\bullet$
(for example a canonical one, see 
Injectives, Section \ref{injectives-section-injectives-sheaves}).
Let $X$ be an object of $\mathcal{C}$. We want to compute 
$R\Gamma(X, \mathcal{F}) = \Gamma(X, \mathcal{J}^\bullet)$
or at least the cohomology groups $H^j(X, \mathcal{F})$.
The idea is to construct simplicial objects $U_\bullet$ 
augmented towards $X$, so $U_\bullet \to X$, such that 
$$
R\Gamma(X, \mathcal{F}) 
= \text{Tot}(R\Gamma(U_\bullet, \mathcal{J}^\bullet))
\leqno{(*)}
$$
is a quasi-isomorphism (for any $\mathcal{F}$). On the right hand 
side this is the total complex associated to the double complex. 
(The maps are always canonical since we have the resolution over 
all of $\mathcal{C}$.)
The complex $\Gamma(U_\bullet, \mathcal{F})$ maps into the
complex on the right. We will show that for any
element $\eta \in H^j(X, \mathcal{F})$ there exists a choice
of $U_\bullet \to X$ such that $\eta$ comes from an element
in $H^j(U_\bullet, \mathcal{F})$. This is a first step and
it already allows us to define cup products for example.
The starting point is the following.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-product-hypercovering}
Suppose that $\{Y \to X\}$ is a covering in the topology of
$\mathcal{C}$. Let $U_n = Y^n_{/X}$ be the simplicial
object defined in Example \ref{example-fibre-products-simplicial-object}.
The augmentation $U_\bullet \to X$ has the property
that $(*)$ is a quasi-isomorphism for all $\mathcal{F}$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
FIXME.
\end{proof}

\section{Making simplicial objects}
\label{section-making-simplicial}

\noindent
Suppose that $U_\bullet$ is a simplicial object of $\mathcal{C}$. Now let
$n\geq 0$ and let $V \to U_n$ be a representable morphism of 
$\mathcal{C}$. This means that the fibre products $V \times_{U_n} W$ 
exist for all morphisms $W \to U_n$.

\medskip\noindent
For any $m$ consider the fibre product (over $U_m$)
$$
U'_m = \prod\nolimits_{\varphi \in \text{Mor}_\Delta([n],[m])}
V\times_{U_n, U_\bullet(\varphi)} U_m.
$$
By our assumption on the morphism $V \to U_n$ this fibre product
exists. For any $\psi : [m1] \to [m2]$ there is a canonical morphism
$U'_{m2} \to U'_{m1}$ coming from the map $\text{Mor}_\Delta([n],[m1])
\to \text{Mor}_\Delta([n],[m2]), \varphi \mapsto \varphi \circ \psi$,
the identity map on $V$ and the canonical map $U_\bullet(\psi) : 
U_{m2} \to U_{m1}$

\medskip\noindent
Clearly, these data give rise to a simplicial object $U'_\bullet$ in
$\mathcal{C}$. The natural morphisms $U'_m \to U_m$ give rise to a
morphism of simplicial objects $U'_\bullet \to U_\bullet$. Note that
the morphism $U'_n \to U_n$ factors throught the morphism $V \to U_n$
by projection onto the factor corresponding to $\varphi=\text{id}_{[n]}$.
Also, note that if $\mathcal{C}$ is a site and if 
$\{V \to U_n\}$ is a covering in the site then for any $m$ it is true
that $\{U'_m \to U_m\}$ is a covering. This proves the following lemma.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-construct-new-covers}
Suppose that $U_\bullet$ and $V\to U_n$ are as above such that
$\{V \to U_n\}$ is a covering for the topology on the site
$\mathcal{C}$. The morphism of simplicial objects 
$U'_\bullet \to U_\bullet$ constructed above has the following 
properties:
(1) The morphism $U'_n \to U_n$ factors trough $V \to U_n$.
(2) For any $m$ the set $\{U'_m \to U_m\}$ is a covering
in the topology of $\mathcal{C}$.
\end{lemma}

\section{Doubly simplicial stuff}
\label{section-doubly-simplicial}

\noindent
A doubly simplicial object of $\mathcal{C}$ is a functor
$U_{\bullet,\bullet} : (\Delta\times\Delta)^\circ \to \mathcal{C}$.
By subdividing we can make this into a simplicial object 
$W(U_{\bullet,\bullet})$ with the same cohomology. FIXME: Explain this.

\noindent
Suppose that $U'_\bullet \to U_\bullet$ is a morphism of simplicial
objects of $\mathcal{C}$ such that each of the morphisms $U'_n \to
U_n$ is representable. Then we can construct a doubly-simplicial
object $U'_{\bullet,\bullet}$ by setting $U'_{n,0}= U'_n$,
$$
U'_{n,1} = U'_n \times_{U_n} U'_n,
$$
etc. Compare Example \ref{example-fibre-products-simplicial-object}. 
Out of this object we can construct a single simplicial object
$W(U'_{\bullet,\bullet})$ as explained above. Construct the 
natural morphism of simplicial objects 
$W(U'_{\bullet,\bullet}) \to U_\bullet$.

\begin{lemma}
Suppose that every $\{U'_n \to U_n\}$ is a covering for the topology
of $\mathcal{C}$. Suppose that $\mathcal{F}$ is a sheaf on 
$\mathcal{C}$. Then there is a natural
morphism of complexes
$$
R\Gamma(U_\bullet, \mathcal{F}) \to 
R\Gamma(W(U_{\bullet,\bullet}), \mathcal{F})
$$
which is a quasi-isomorphism. FIXME: Something like this in any case.
\end{lemma}

\section{The general case}

\noindent
Mention how things work more generally, for example if $\mathcal{C}$
does not have the property that coverings consisting of a single map
are cofinal. State the theorem in the correct generality.
