\section{Introduction}
\label{section-introduction}

\noindent
Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a site, see Sites, Definition \ref{sites-definition-site}.
Let $X$ be an object of $\mathcal{C}$.
Given an abelian sheaf $\mathcal{F}$
on $\mathcal{C}$ we would like to compute
its cohomology groups
$$
H^i(X, \mathcal{F}).
$$
According to our general definitions
(insert future reference here)
this cohomology group is computed by
choosing an injective resolution
$$
0 \to \mathcal{F} \to \mathcal{I}^0 \to \mathcal{I}^1 \to \ldots
$$
and setting
$$
H^i(X, \mathcal{F})
=
H^i(
\Gamma(X, \mathcal{I}^0) \to
\Gamma(X, \mathcal{I}^1) \to
\Gamma(X, \mathcal{I}^2)\to \ldots)
$$
We will have to do quite a bit of work to prove that we
may also compute these cohomology groups without
choosing an injective resolution. Also, we will only do this
in case the site $\mathcal{C}$ has fibre products.

\medskip\noindent
A hypercovering in a site is a generalization of a covering.
See \cite[Expose V, Sec. 7]{SGA4}. A hypercovering is a special
case of a simplicial augmentation where one has cohomological
descent, see \cite[Expose Vbis]{SGA4}. A nice manuscript on
cohomological descent is the text by Brian Conrad, see
\url{http://math.stanford.edu/~conrad/papers/hypercover.pdf}.
Brian's text follows the exposition in \cite[Expose Vbis]{SGA4}, and in
particular discusses a more general kind of hypercoverings, such as
proper hypercoverings of schemes used to compute etale cohomology
for example. A proper hypercovering can be seen as a hypercovering
in the category of schemes endowed with a different topology than
the etale topology, but still they can be used to compute the etale
cohomology.





























\section{Hypercoverings}
\label{section-hypercoverings}

\noindent
In order to start we make the following definition.
The letters ``SR'' stand for Semi-Representable.

\begin{definition}
\label{definition-SR}
Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a site with fibre products.
Let $X \in \text{Ob}(\mathcal{C})$ be an object of $\mathcal{C}$.
We denote $\text{SR}(\mathcal{C}, X)$ the category with
\begin{enumerate}
\item objects are families of morphisms
$\{U_i \to X\}_{i \in I}$, and
\item morphisms $\{U_i \to X\}_{i \in I} \to
\{V_j \to X\}_{j \in J}$ are given by
a map $\alpha : I \to J$ and for each $i \in I$
a morphism $f_i : U_i \to V_{\alpha(i)}$ over $X$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

\noindent
This definition is different from the one in
\cite[Expose V, Sec. 7]{SGA4}, but it seems flexible
enough to do all the required arguments.
Note that this is a ``big'' category. We will later
``bound'' the size of the index sets $I$ that we need
and we can then redefine $\text{SR}(\mathcal{C}, X)$ 
to become a category.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-coprod-prod-SR}
Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a site with fibre products.
Let $X \in \text{Ob}(\mathcal{C})$ be an object of $\mathcal{C}$.
The category $\text{SR}(\mathcal{C}, X)$ has
coproducts and finite limits.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
It is clear that the coproduct of
$\{U_i \to X\}_{i \in I}$ and $\{V_j \to X\}_{j \in J}$
is $\{U_i \to X\}_{i \in I} \coprod \{V_j \to X\}_{j \in J}$
and similarly for coproducts of
families of families of morphisms with target $X$.
The object $\{X \to X\}$ is a final
object of $\text{SR}(\mathcal{C}, X)$.
Suppose given a morphism
$(\alpha, f_i) : \{U_i \to X\}_{i \in I} \to \{V_j \to X\}_{j \in J}$
and a morphism
$(\beta, g_k) : \{W_k \to X\}_{k \in K} \to \{V_j \to X\}_{j \in J}$.
The fibred product of these morphisms is given by
$$
\{ U_i \times_{f_i, V_j, g_k} W_k \to X \}_{(i,j,k) \in I\times J\times K
\text{ such that } k = \alpha(i) = \beta(j)}
$$
The fibre products exist by the assumption that
$\mathcal{C}$ has fibre products.
Thus $\text{SR}(\mathcal{C}, X)$ has finite limits,
see Categories, Lemma \ref{categories-lemma-finite-limits-exist}.
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}
\label{definition-covering-SR}
Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a site with fibred products.
Let $X \in \text{Ob}(\mathcal{C})$ be an object of $\mathcal{C}$.
Let $f = (\alpha, f_i) : \{U_i \to X\}_{i \in I} \to \{V_j \to X\}_{j \in J}$
be a morphism in the category $\text{SR}(\mathcal{C}, X)$.
We say that $f$ is a {\it covering} if for every $j \in J$ the
family of morphisms $\{U_i \to V_j\}_{i \in I, \alpha(i) = j}$
is a covering for the site $\mathcal{C}$.
\end{definition}

\noindent
According to the results in the chapter on simplicial methods the
coskelet of a truncated simplicial object of
$\text{SR}(\mathcal{C}, X)$ exists. Hence the following
definition makes sense.

\begin{definition}
\label{definition-hypercovering}
Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a site.
Let $X \in \text{Ob}(\mathcal{C})$ be an object of $\mathcal{C}$.
A {\it hypercovering} of $X$ is a simplicial object
$K$ in the category $\text{SR}(\mathcal{C}, X)$ such that
\begin{enumerate}
\item The object $K_0$ is a covering of $X$ for the site $\mathcal{C}$.
\item
For every $n \geq 0$ the canonical morphism
$$
K_{n + 1} \longrightarrow (\text{cosk}_n \text{sk}_n K)_{n + 1}
$$
is a covering in the sense defined above.
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

\noindent
Condition (1) makes sense since each object of
$\text{SR}(\mathcal{C}, X)$ is after all a family
of morphisms with target $X$.

\begin{example}
\label{example-cech}
Let $\{U_i \to X\}_{i \in I}$ be a covering of the site $\mathcal{C}$.
Set $K_0 = \{U_i \to X\}_{i \in I}$.
Then $K_0$ is a $0$-truncated simplicial object of
$\text{SR}(\mathcal{C}, X)$. Hence we may form
$$
K = \text{cosk}_0 K_0.
$$
Clearly $K$ passes condition (1) of Definition \ref{definition-hypercovering}.
Since all the morphisms $K_{n + 1} \to (\text{cosk}_n \text{sk}_n K)_{n + 1}$
are isomorphisms it also passes condition (2). Note that
the terms $K_n$ are the usual
$$
K_n = \{
U_{i_0} \times_X U_{i_1} \times_X \ldots \times_X U_{i_n} \to X
\}_{(i_0, i_1, \ldots, i_n) \in I^{n + 1}}
$$
\end{example}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-hypercoverings-set}
Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a site.
Let $X \in \text{Ob}(\mathcal{C})$ be an object of $\mathcal{C}$.
The collection of all hypercoverings of $X$ forms a set.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Since $\mathcal{C}$ is a site, the set of all coverings of
$S$ forms a set. Thus we see that the collection
of possible $K_0$ forms a set. Suppose we have shown that
the collection of all possible $K_0, \ldots, K_n$ form
a set. Then it is enough to show that given
$K_0, \ldots, K_n$ the collection of all possible
$K_{n + 1}$ forms a set. And this is clearly true since
we have to choose $K_{n + 1}$ among all possible coverings
of $(\text{cosk}_n \text{sk}_n K)_{n + 1}$.
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}
\label{remark-hypercoverings-really-set}
The lemma does not just say that there is a cofinal
system of choices of hypercoverings that is a set,
but that really the hypercoverings form a set.
\end{remark}

\section{Acyclicity}
\label{section-acyclicity}

\noindent

















\section{Covering simplicial objects}
\label{section-making-simplicial}

\noindent
Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a category.
Let $U$ be a simplicial object of $\mathcal{C}$.
Suppose $n\geq 0$, and suppose $\pi : V \to U_n$ is
a representable morphism of $\mathcal{C}$. This
means that the fibre products $V \times_{U_n} W$
exist for all morphisms $W \to U_n$.

\medskip\noindent
For any $k \geq 0$ consider the fibre product over $U_k$
$$
U'_k = \prod\nolimits_{\varphi \in \text{Mor}_\Delta([n],[k])}
V\times_{U_n, U(\varphi)} U_k.
$$
By our assumption on the morphism $V \to U_n$ this fibre product
exists. For any $T \in \text{Ob}(\mathcal{C})$ the set of morphism
$T \to U'_k$ is given by the following formula
$$ 
\{
(f : T \to U_k, (f_\varphi : T \to V)_{\varphi \in \text{Mor}_\Delta([n],[k])})
\mid
\pi \circ f_{\varphi} = U(\varphi) \circ f\ \forall \varphi
\}
$$
For any $\psi : [l] \to [k]$ there is a canonical morphism
$U'_k \to U'_l$ coming from the map $\text{Mor}_\Delta([n],[l])
\to \text{Mor}_\Delta([n],[k]), \varphi \mapsto \varphi \circ \psi$,
the identity map on $V$ and the morphism
$U(\psi) : U_k \to U_l$. In terms of the $T$-valued points
it maps $(f, (f_\varphi)_\varphi)$ to the collection
$(U(\psi) \circ f, (f_{\varphi \circ \psi})_{\varphi})$.

\medskip\noindent
Clearly, this gives rise to a simplicial object $U'$ of
$\mathcal{C}$. The natural morphisms $U'_m \to U_m$ give rise to a
morphism of simplicial objects $U' \to U$. Note that
the morphism $U'_n \to U_n$ factors throught the morphism $V \to U_n$
by projection onto the factor corresponding to $\varphi=\text{id}_{[n]}$.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-construct-new-covers}
Suppose that $U$ and $V\to U_n$ are as above.
The morphism of simplicial objects 
$U' \to U$ constructed above has the following 
properties:
(1) The morphism $U'_n \to U_n$ factors trough $V \to U_n$.
(2) For any $m$ the morphism $U'_m \to U_m$
is a fibre product over $U_m$ of base changes
of the morphism $V \to U_n$.
\end{lemma}


















\section{The general case}

\noindent
Mention how things work more generally, for example if $\mathcal{C}$
does not have the property that coverings consisting of a single map
are cofinal. State the theorem in the correct generality.
