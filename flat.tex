\section{The local structure of a finite type module}
\label{section-local-structure-module}

\noindent
The key technical lemma that makes a lot of the arguments in this
chapter work is the geometric
Lemma \ref{lemma-elementary-devissage}.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-sheaf-lives-on-subscheme}
Let $f : X \to S$ be a finite type morphism of affine schemes.
Let $\mathcal{F}$ be a finite type quasi-coherent $\mathcal{O}_X$-module.
Let $x \in X$ with image $s = f(x)$ in $S$.
Set $\mathcal{F}_s = \mathcal{F}|_{X_s}$.
Then there exist a closed immersion $i : Z \to X$ of finite presentation,
and a quasi-coherent finite type $\mathcal{O}_Z$-module $\mathcal{G}$
such that $i_*\mathcal{G} = \mathcal{F}$ and
$Z_s = \text{Supp}(\mathcal{F}_s)$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Say the morphism $f : X \to S$ is given by the ring map
$A \to B$ and that $\mathcal{F}$ is the quasi-coherent sheaf
associated to the $B$-module $M$. By
Morphisms, Lemma \ref{morphisms-lemma-locally-finite-type-characterize}
we know that $A \to B$ is a finite type ring map, and by
Properties, Lemma \ref{properties-lemma-finite-type-module}
we know that $M$ is a finite $B$-module. In particular the
support of $\mathcal{F}$ is the closed subscheme of $\text{Spec}(B)$
cut out by the annihilator
$I = \{x \in B \mid xm = 0\ \forall m \in M\}$ of $M$, see
Algebra, Lemma \ref{algebra-lemma-support-closed}.
Let $\mathfrak q \subset B$ be the prime ideal corresponding to $x$
and let $\mathfrak p \subset A$ be the prime ideal corresponding to $s$.
Note that $X_s = \text{Spec}(B \otimes_A \kappa(\mathfrak p))$ and
that $\mathcal{F}_s$ is the quasi-coherent sheaf associated to the
$B \otimes_A \kappa(\mathfrak p)$ module $M \otimes_A \kappa(\mathfrak p)$. By
Divisors, Lemma \ref{divisors-lemma-support-finite-type}
the support of $\mathcal{F}_s$ is equal to
$V(I(B \otimes_A \kappa(\mathfrak p)))$. Since
$B \otimes_A \kappa(\mathfrak p)$ is of finite type over $\kappa(\mathfrak p)$
there exist finitely many elements $f_1, \ldots, f_m \in I$
such that
$$
I(B \otimes_A \kappa(\mathfrak p)) =
(f_1, \ldots, f_n)(B \otimes_A \kappa(\mathfrak p)).
$$
Denote $i : Z \to X$ the closed subscheme cut out by
$(f_1, \ldots, f_m)$, in a formula $Z = \text{Spec}(B/(f_1, \ldots, f_m))$.
Since $M$ is annihilated by $I$ we can think of $M$ as an
$B/(f_1, \ldots, f_m)$-module. In other words, $\mathcal{F}$ is the
pushforward of a finite type module on $Z$.
As $Z_s = \text{Supp}(\mathcal{F}_s)$ by construction, this
proves the lemma.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-lift-etale}
Let $i : Z \to X$ be a closed immersion of affine schemes.
Let $Z' \to Z$ be an etale morphism with $Z'$ affine.
Then there exists an etale morphism $X' \to X$ with $X'$
affine such that $Z' \cong Z \times_X X'$ as schemes over $Z$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
See
Algebra, Lemma \ref{algebra-lemma-lift-etale}.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-elementary-devissage}
Let $f : X \to S$ be morphism of schemes which is locally of finite type.
Let $\mathcal{F}$ be a finite type quasi-coherent $\mathcal{O}_X$-module.
Let $x \in X$ with image $s = f(x)$ in $S$.
Set $\mathcal{F}_s = \mathcal{F}|_{X_s}$ and
$n = \dim_x(\text{Supp}(\mathcal{F}_s))$.
Then we can construct
\begin{enumerate}
\item elementary etale neighbourhoods $g : (X', x') \to (X, x)$,
$e : (S', s') \to (S, s)$,
\item a commutative diagram
$$
\xymatrix{
X' \ar[d]_g & Z' \ar[l]^i \ar[r]_\pi & Y' \ar[r]_h & S' \ar[d]^e \\
X \ar[rrr]^f & & & S
}
$$
\item a point $z' \in Z'$ with $i(z') = x'$, $y' = \pi(z')$, $h(y') = s'$,
\item a finite type quasi-coherent $\mathcal{O}_{Z'}$-module $\mathcal{G}$,
\end{enumerate}
such that the following properties hold
\begin{enumerate}
\item $X'$, $Z'$, $Y'$, $S'$ are affine schemes,
\item $i$ is a closed immersion of finite presentation,
\item $i_*(\mathcal{G}) \cong g^*\mathcal{F}$,
\item $\pi$ is finite and $\pi^{-1}(\{y'\}) = \{x'\}$,
\item $h$ is smooth of relative dimension $n$
with geometrically integral fibres.
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Let $V \subset S$ be an affine neighbourhood of $s$.
Let $U \subset f^{-1}(V)$ be an affine neighbourhood of $x$.
Then it suffices to prove the lemma for $f|_U : U \to V$ and
$\mathcal{F}|_U$. Hence in the rest of the proof we assume that
$X$ and $S$ are affine.

\medskip\noindent
First, suppose that $X_s = \text{Supp}(\mathcal{F}_s)$, in particular
$n = \dim_x(X_s)$. Apply
More on Morphisms,
Lemmas \ref{more-morphisms-lemma-local-local-structure-finite-type} and
\ref{more-morphisms-lemma-local-local-structure-finite-type-affine}.
This gives us a commutative diagram
$$
\xymatrix{
X' \ar[d]_g \ar[r]_\pi & Y' \ar[r]_h & S' \ar[d]^e \\
X \ar[rr]^f & & S
}
$$
and point $x' \in X'$. We set $Z' = X'$, $i = \text{id}$, and
$\mathcal{G} = g^*\mathcal{F}$ to obtain a solution in this case.

\medskip\noindent
In general choose a closed immersion $Z \to X$ and a sheaf
$\mathcal{G}$ on $Z$ as in
Lemma \ref{lemma-sheaf-lives-on-subscheme}.
Applying the result of the previous paragraph to $Z \to S$ and
$\mathcal{G}$ we obtain a diagram
$$
\xymatrix{
 & Z' \ar[d]_g \ar[r]_\pi & Y' \ar[r]_h & S' \ar[d]^e \\
X & Z \ar[l] \ar[rr]^{f|_Z} & & S
}
$$
and point $z' \in Z'$ satisfying all the required properties.
Finally, as $X$, $Z$, $Z'$ are all affine we may apply
Lemma \ref{lemma-lift-etale}
to get an etale morphism of affine schemes $X' \to X$ such that 
$Z' = Z \times_X X'$. Let $x' \in X'$ be the point corresponding to
$z' \in Z'$. Then the completed diagram
$$
\xymatrix{
X' \ar[d] & Z' \ar[l]_i \ar[r]_\pi & Y' \ar[r]_h & S' \ar[d]^e \\
X \ar[rrr]^f & & & S
}
$$
is a solution of the original problem.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-devissage-finite-presentation}
Assumptions and notation as in
Lemma \ref{lemma-elementary-devissage}.
If $f$ is locally of finite presentation
then $\pi$ is of finite presentation.
In this case the following are equivalent
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\mathcal{F}$ is an $\mathcal{O}_X$-module of finite presentation
in a neighbourhood of $x$,
\item $\mathcal{G}$ is an $\mathcal{O}_{Z'}$-module of finite presentation
in a neighbourhood of $z'$, and
\item $\pi_*\mathcal{G}$ is an $\mathcal{O}_{Y'}$-module of
finite presentation in a neighbourhood of $y'$.
\end{enumerate}
Still assuming $f$ locally of finite presentation the following are
equivalent to each other
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(a)] $\mathcal{F}_x$ is an $\mathcal{O}_{X, x}$-module of finite
presentation,
\item[(b)] $\mathcal{G}_{z'}$ is an $\mathcal{O}_{Z', z'}$-module of
finite presentation, and
\item[(c)] $(\pi_*\mathcal{G})_{y'}$ is an $\mathcal{O}_{Y', y'}$-module
of finite presentation.
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Assume $f$ locally of finite presentation. Then $Z' \to S$ is locally
of finite presentation as a composition of such, see
Morphisms, Lemma \ref{morphisms-lemma-composition-finite-presentation}.
Note that $Y' \to S$ is also locally of finite type as a composition
of a smooth and an etale morphism. Hence
Morphisms, Lemma \ref{morphisms-lemma-finite-presentation-permanence}
implies $\pi$ is locally of finite presentation.
Since $\pi$ is finite we conclude that it is also separated and
quasi-compact, hence $\pi$ is actually of finite presentation.

\medskip\noindent
To prove the equivalence of (1), (2), and (3) we also consider:
(4) $g^*\mathcal{F}$ is a $\mathcal{O}_{X'}$-module of finite presentation
in a neighbourhood of $x'$. The pull back of a module of finite presentation
is of finite presentation, see
Modules, Lemma \ref{modules-lemma-pullback-finite-presentation}.
Hence (1) $\Rightarrow$ (4).
Recall that as $g$ is an etale morphism it is open, see
Morphisms, Lemma \ref{morphisms-lemma-etale-open}.
Hence (4) $\Rightarrow$ (1) by
Descent, Lemma \ref{descent-lemma-finite-presentation-descends}.
Using
Descent, Lemma \ref{descent-lemma-finite-finitely-presented-module}
and some easy topological arguments (omitted) we see that
(4) $\Leftrightarrow$ (2) $\Leftrightarrow$ (3).

\medskip\noindent
To prove the equivalence of (a), (b), (c) consider the ring maps
$$
\mathcal{O}_{X, x} \to
\mathcal{O}_{X', x'} \to
\mathcal{O}_{Z', z'} \leftarrow
\mathcal{O}_{Y', y'}
$$
The first ring map is faithfully flat. Hence
$\mathcal{F}_x$ is of finite presentation over $\mathcal{O}_{X, x}$
if and only if $g^*\mathcal{F}_{x'}$ is of finite presentation over
$\mathcal{O}_{X', x'}$, see
Algebra, Lemma \ref{algebra-lemma-descend-properties-modules}.
The second ring map is surjective (hence finite) and
finitely presented by assumption, hence
$g^*\mathcal{F}_{x'}$ is of finite presentation over $\mathcal{O}_{X', x'}$
if and only if $\mathcal{G}_{z'}$ is of finite presentation over
$\mathcal{O}_{Z', z'}$, see
Algebra, Lemma \ref{algebra-lemma-finite-finitely-presented-extension}.
Because $\pi$ is finite, of finite presentation, and
$\pi^{-1}(\{y'\}) = \{x'\}$ the ring homomorphism
$\mathcal{O}_{Y', y'} \leftarrow \mathcal{O}_{Z', z'}$ is finite
and of finite presentation, see
More on Morphisms,
Lemma \ref{more-morphisms-lemma-finite-morphism-single-point-in-fibre}.
Hence $\mathcal{G}_{z'}$ is of finite presentation over $\mathcal{O}_{Z', z'}$
if and only if $\pi_*\mathcal{G}_{y'}$ is of finite presentation over
$\mathcal{O}_{Y', y'}$, see
Algebra, Lemma \ref{algebra-lemma-finite-finitely-presented-extension}.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-devissage-flat}
Assumptions and notation as in
Lemma \ref{lemma-elementary-devissage}.
The following are equivalent
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\mathcal{F}$ is flat over $S$ in a neighbourhood of $x$,
\item $\mathcal{G}$ is flat over $S'$ in a neighbourhood of $z'$, and
\item $\pi_*\mathcal{G}$ is flat over $S'$ in a neighbourhood of $y'$.
\end{enumerate}
The following are equivalent also
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\mathcal{F}_x$ is flat over $\mathcal{O}_{S, s}$,
\item $\mathcal{G}_{z'}$ is flat over $\mathcal{O}_{S', s'}$, and
\item $(\pi_*\mathcal{G})_{y'}$ is flat over $\mathcal{O}_{S', s'}$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}




\section{Flattening stratification}
\label{section-flattening}

\noindent
If $f : X \to S$ is a proper, finitely presented morphism
of schemes then one can find a stratification of the base
over whose members the morphism $f$ is flat. It is not so hard
to find this stratification, but what is a bit tricky is to prove
that this stratification is characterized by a universal property.
In this section we discuss this and some of its variants.

\medskip\noindent
The first case is where the base is the spectrum of a complete
local Noetherian ring. In this case the closed stratum is defined
and satisfies the desired universal property even for a general
finite type morphism, provided we {\it only} look for flatness in
points lying over the closed point.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-flattening-complete-noetherian}
Let $f : X \to S$ be a morphism of schemes.
Let $\mathcal{F}$ be a quasi-coherent sheaf on $X$.
Assume
\begin{enumerate}
\item $S = \text{Spec}(A)$ is the spectrum of a Noetherian complete
local ring $A$,
\item $f$ is of finite type, and
\item $\mathcal{F}$ is a finite type $\mathcal{O}_X$-module.
\end{enumerate}
Then there exists a closed subscheme $Z \subset S$ with the following
universal property: Given a morphism $S' \to S$ which corresponds to
a local homomorphism $A' \to A$ of local rings the following
are equivalent
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(a)] the pullback $\mathcal{F}'$ of $\mathcal{F}$ to
$X' = S' \times_S X$ is flat over $S'$ at all points $x' \in X'$
lying over the closed point of $S'$, and
\item[(b)] $S' \to S$ factors through $Z$.
\end{enumerate}
In particular, $Z$ is the largest closed subscheme of $S$ such that
$\mathcal{F}|_{X_Z}$ is flat over $Z$ at all points
of $X_Z$ lying over the closed point of $Z$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
As $f$ is of finite type it is quasi-compact. Hence $X$ is quasi-compact.
Choose a finite affine open covering $X = \bigcup X_i$.
Write $X_i = \text{Spec}(B_i)$ so that $A \to B_i$ is a finite type
ring map. Note that $\mathcal{F}|_{X_i}$ corresponds to a finite
$B_i$-module $M_i$. Set $Y = \coprod X_i = \text{Spec}(\prod B_i)$
and $\mathcal{G} = \widetilde{\prod M_i}$ on $Y$.
Now if $S' \to S$ is a morphism as in the lemma, then (a) holds
for $\mathcal{F}'$ relative to $X' \to S'$ if and only if (a) holds for
$\mathcal{G}'$ relative to $Y' \to S'$. Hence this
reduces us to the case where $X$ is affine.
In this case $Z$ exists by
Algebra,
Lemma \ref{algebra-lemma-flattening-complete-local-universal-property}.
(Hint: We strongly suggest the reader only read the construction of
$Z = \text{Spec}(A/I)$ in
Algebra, Lemma \ref{algebra-lemma-flattening-complete-local-noetherian}.)
\end{proof}
