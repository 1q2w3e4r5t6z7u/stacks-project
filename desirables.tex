\title{Desirables}

\begin{abstract}
OK, here are some ideas about how to write a text about
stacks, what should go into it, and fixing ideas for some
of the definitions. Please email comments to the
\href{mailto:stacks.project@gmail.com}{stacks.project@gmail.com}.

\section{Introduction}
\label{section-introduction}

\noindent
This is basically just a list of things that we want to put in the stacks
project. As we add material to the project continuously this is always
somewhat behind the current state of the project.


\section{Conventions}
\label{section-conventions}

\noindent
We should have a chapter with a short list of conventions used in the document.
This chapter already exists, see
Conventions, Section \ref{conventions-section-comments},
but a lot more could be added there. Especially useful would be to find
``hidden'' conventions and tacit assumptions and put those there.


\section{Sites and Topoi}
\label{section-sites}

\noindent
We have a chapter on sites and sheaves, see
Sites, Section \ref{sites-section-introduction}.
We have a chapter on ringed sites (and topoi) and modules on them, see
Modules on Sites, Section \ref{sites-modules-section-introduction}.
We have a chapter on cohomology in this setting, see
Cohomology on Sites, Section \ref{sites-cohomology-section-introduction}.
But a lot more could be added, especially in the chapter on cohomology.


\section{Stacks}
\label{section-stacks}

\noindent
We have a chapter on (abstract) stacks, see
Stacks, Section \ref{stacks-section-introduction}.
It would be nice if
\begin{enumerate}
\item improve the discussion on ``stackyfication'',
\item give examples of stackyfication,
\item more examples in general,
\item a discussion of gerbes is missing sofar.
\end{enumerate}

\medskip\noindent
Example result: Given a sheaf of abelian groups $\mathcal{F}$
over $\mathcal{C}$ the set of equivalence classes of gerbes with ``group''
$\mathcal{F}$ is bijective to $H^2(\mathcal{C}, \mathcal{F})$.


\section{Simplicial methods}
\label{section-simplicial}

\noindent
We have a chapter on simplicial methods, see
Simplicial, Section \ref{simplicial-section-introduction}.
This has to be reviewed and improved. Moreover, there should be a
chapter on ``simplicial algebraic geometry'', where we discuss
simplicial schemes, and how to think of their geometry, cohomology,
etc. Then this should be tied into the chapter on hypercoverings
to ``explain'' the results of this chapter in the new language.


\section{Cohomology of schemes}
\label{section-schemes-cohomology}

\noindent
There is already a chapter on cohomology of quasi-coherent sheaves, see
Coherent, Section \ref{coherent-section-introduction}.
What is missing are chapters on \'etale cohomology and flat cohomology
of schemes, the relation with Galois cohomology etc.


\section{Deformation theory a la Schlessinger}
\label{section-deformation-schlessinger}

\noindent
What is needed is a discussion of Schlessinger's paper first and foremost.
It would be nice to discuss this a tiny bit more generally than in
Schlessinger's paper, but it is easy to fix this up later also.
For example we could discuss what happens if you have automorphisms
(e.g., functor in groupoids). After all this is usually why you have
hulls and not actual prorepresentability.


\section{Definition of algebraic stacks}
\label{section-definition-algebraic-stacks}

\noindent
An algebraic stack is a stack that has a diagonal representable by algebraic
spaces, that is the target of a surjective smooth morphism from a scheme.

\medskip\noindent
The notion ``Deligne-Mumford stack'' will be reserved for a stack as in
\cite{DM}. We will reserve the term ``Artin stack'' for
a stack such as in the papers by Artin \cite{ArtinI}, and \cite{ArtinVersal}.
(See also \cite{ConradeJong}.) In other words, and Artin stack will be an
algebraic stack with some reasonable finiteness and separatedness conditions.


\section{Examples of schemes, algebraic spaces, algebraic stacks}
\label{section-examples-stacks}

\noindent
It really is not that hard to show that $\mathcal{M}_g$ is an algebraic
stack for $g\geq 2$. We should have $[X/G]$ here. We should really
have a long list of moduli problems here and prove they are all algebraic
stacks. (Some of them we can postpone the proof until after Artin
approximation.) For example the Kontsevich moduli space in characteristic
$p > 0$.

\medskip\noindent
Here are some items for the list of moduli problems mentioned above.
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\mathcal{M}_g$, i.e., moduli of smooth projective curves of genus $g$,
\item $\overline{\mathcal{M}}_g$, i.e., moduli of stable genus $g$ curves,
\item $\mathcal{A}_g$,
i.e., principally polarised abelian schemes of genus $g$,
\item $\mathcal{M}_{1,1}$, i.e.,
$1$-pointed smooth projective genus $1$ curves,
\item $\mathcal{M}_{g, n}$, i.e., smooth projective genus $g$-curves
with $n$ pairwise distinct labeled points,
\item $\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{g, n}$, i.e.,
stable $n$-pointed nodal projective genus $g$-curves,
\item $\SheafHom_S(\mathcal{X},\mathcal{Y})$, moduli of morphisms
(with suitable conditions on the stacks $\mathcal{X}$, $\mathcal{Y}$
and the base scheme $S$),
\item $\textit{Bun}_G(X) = \SheafHom_S(X,BG)$, the stack of $G$-bundles
of the geometric Langlands programme (with suitable conditions on the scheme
$X$, the group scheme $G$, and the base scheme $S$),
\item $\textit{Pic}_{\mathcal{X}/S}$, i.e., the Picard stack associated
to an algebraic stack over a base scheme (or space).
\end{enumerate}

\medskip\noindent
How about the algebraic space you get from the deformation theory of
a general surface in $\mathbf{P}^3$ with a node? (I mean where you deform
it to a general smooth surface in $\mathbf{P}^3$.)

\medskip\noindent
Perhaps we can talk about some small dimensional examples here too.
For example the stack where you have $\mathbf{A}^1$ with a $B(\mathbf{Z}/2)$
sitting at $0$. Bugeyed covers. You name it.

\section{Properties of algebraic stacks}
\label{section-stacks-properties}

\noindent
Such as the various ways of defining what a proper algebraic stack is.
Of course these things are really properties of morphisms of stacks.

\medskip\noindent
We can define singularities (up to smooth factors) etc. Prove that a
connected normal stack is irreducible, etc.

\section{Lisse \'etale site of an algebraic stack}
\label{section-lisse-etale}

\noindent
This has to be explained and introduced. Explain it is not functorial with
respect to $1$-morphisms of algebraic stacks. Define \'etale cohomology of an
algebraic stack with coefficients in a sheaf on the lisse-\'etale site.
Prove a Leray spectral sequence exists (always?). Explain about cohomology
of quasi-coherent sheaves.

\section{Things you always wanted to know but were afraid to ask}
\label{section-stacks-fun-lemmas}

\noindent
There are going to be lots of lemmas that you use over and over again
that are useful but aren't really mentioned specifically in the literature,
or it isn't easy to find references for. Bag of tricks.

\medskip\noindent
Example: Given two groupoids in schemes $R\Rightarrow U$ and
$R' \Rightarrow U'$ what does it mean to have a $1$-morphism
$[U/R] \to [U'/R']$ purely in terms of groupoids in schemes.
(This is bad because surely this is in the lit somewhere.)
More anybody?

\section{Quasi-coherent sheaves on stacks}
\label{section-quasi-coherent}

\noindent
Define them and explain how you get them. You can define them as living on the
lisse-\'etale site or on all of the stack and show the two notions are
equivalent. Cohomology of quasi-coherent sheaves.


\section{Flat and smooth}
\label{section-flat-smooth}

\noindent
Artin's theorem that having a flat surjection from a scheme is a replacement
for the smooth surjective condition.


\section{Artin's representability theorem}
\label{section-representability}

\noindent
Title is clear enough. Perhaps we can reformulate the condition of having a
deformation theory a little to adapt it more to the examples we know about,
especially those where there is a perfect obstruction theory (discussions
with Jason)?


\section{DM stacks are finitely covered by schemes}
\label{section-dm-finite-cover}

\noindent
This all begins with Gabber's lemma I think. Somewhere in Asterisque about
Faltings proof of Mordell?


\section{Martin Olson's paper on properness}
\label{section-proper-parametrization}

\noindent
This proves two notions of proper are the same. We can also discuss Faltings
result that it suffices to use DVR's in certain cases.


\section{Proper pushforward of coherent sheaves}
\label{section-proper-pushforward}

\noindent
No comments yet.


\section{Keel and Mori}
\label{section-keel-mori}

\noindent
See \cite{K-M}. The steps in this article also give a good way of looking at
what an algebraic stack locally looks like.


\section{Add more here}
\label{section-add-more}

\noindent
Please.
