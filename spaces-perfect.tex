\section{Introduction}
\label{section-introduction}

\noindent
In this chapter we discuss derived categories of modules on algebraic spaces.
There do not seem to be good introductory references addressing this topic;
it is covered in the literature by referring to papers dealing with derived
categories of modules on algebraic stacks, for example see
\cite{olsson_sheaves}.



\section{Conventions}
\label{section-conventions}

\noindent
If $\mathcal{A}$ is an abelian category and $M$ is an object
of $\mathcal{A}$ then we also denote $M$ the object of $K(\mathcal{A})$
and/or $D(\mathcal{A})$ corresponding to the complex which has
$M$ in degree $0$ and is zero in all other degrees.

\medskip\noindent
If we have a ring $A$, then $K(A)$ denotes the homotopy category
of complexes of $A$-modules and $D(A)$ the associated derived category.
Similarly, if we have a ringed space $(X, \mathcal{O}_X)$ the symbol
$K(\mathcal{O}_X)$ denotes the homotopy category of complexes of
$\mathcal{O}_X$-modules and $D(\mathcal{O}_X)$ the associated derived
category.
