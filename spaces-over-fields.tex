\section{Introduction}
\label{section-introduction}

\noindent
This chapter is the analogue of the chapter on varieties in the setting
of algebraic spaces. A reference for algebraic spaces is
\cite{Kn}.


\section{Conventions}
\label{section-conventions}

\noindent
The standing assumption is that all schemes are contained in
a big fppf site $\Sch_{fppf}$. And all rings $A$ considered
have the property that $\Spec(A)$ is (isomorphic) to an
object of this big site.

\medskip\noindent
Let $S$ be a scheme and let $X$ be an algebraic space over $S$.
In this chapter and the following we will write $X \times_S X$
for the product of $X$ with itself (in the category of algebraic
spaces over $S$), instead of $X \times X$.




\section{Geometric components}
\label{section-geometric-components}


\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-minimal-primes-tensor-strictly-henselian}
Let $k$ be an algebraically closed field. Let $A$, $B$ be strictly
henselian local $k$-algebras with residue field equal to $k$.
Let $C$ be the strict henselization of $A \otimes_k B$ at the maximal
ideal $\mathfrak m_A \otimes_k B + A \otimes_k \mathfrak m_B$.
Then the minimal primes of $C$ correspond $1$-to-$1$ to pairs of
minimal primes of $A$ and $B$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
First note that a minimal prime $\mathfrak r$ of $C$ maps to a minimal
prime $\mathfrak p$ in $A$ and to a minimal prime $\mathfrak q$ of $B$
because the ring maps $A \to C$ and $B \to C$ are flat (by going down for
flat ring map
Algebra, Lemma \ref{algebra-lemma-flat-going-down}).
Hence it suffices to show that the strict henselization of
$(A/\mathfrak p \otimes_k B/\mathfrak q)_{
\mathfrak m_A \otimes_k B + A \otimes_k \mathfrak m_B}$
has a unique minimal prime ideal. By
Algebra, Lemma \ref{algebra-lemma-quotient-strict-henselization}
the rings $A/\mathfrak p$, $B/\mathfrak q$ are strictly henselian.
Hence we may assume that $A$ and $B$ are strictly henselian
local domains and our goal is to show that $C$ has a unique minimal prime. By
Properties of Spaces,
Lemma \ref{spaces-properties-lemma-geometrically-unibranch}.
we see that the integral closure $A'$ of $A$ in its fraction field
is a normal local domain with residue field $k$ and similarly for the
integral closure $B'$ of $B$ into its fraction field. By
Algebra, Lemma \ref{algebra-lemma-geometrically-normal-tensor-normal}
we see that $A' \otimes_k B'$ is a normal ring. Hence its localization
$$
R = (A' \otimes_k B')_{
\mathfrak m_{A'} \otimes_k B' + A' \otimes_k \mathfrak m_{B'}}
$$
is a normal local domain. Note that $A \otimes_k B \to A' \otimes_k B'$
is integral (hence gong up holds --
Algebra, Lemma \ref{algebra-lemma-integral-going-up})
and that $\mathfrak m_{A'} \otimes_k B' + A' \otimes_k \mathfrak m_{B'}$
is the unique maximal ideal of $A' \otimes_k B'$
lying over $\mathfrak m_A \otimes_k B + A \otimes_k \mathfrak m_B$.
Hence we see that
$$
R = (A' \otimes_k B')_{
\mathfrak m_A \otimes_k B + A \otimes_k \mathfrak m_B}
$$
by
Algebra, Lemma \ref{algebra-lemma-unique-prime-over-localize-below}.
It follows that
$$
(A \otimes_k B)_{
\mathfrak m_A \otimes_k B + A \otimes_k \mathfrak m_B}
\longrightarrow
R
$$
is integral. We conclude that $R$ is the integral closure of
$(A \otimes_k B)_{
\mathfrak m_A \otimes_k B + A \otimes_k \mathfrak m_B}$
in its fraction field, and by
Properties of Spaces,
Lemma \ref{spaces-properties-lemma-geometrically-unibranch}
once again we conclude that $C$ has a unique prime ideal.
\end{proof}








\section{Schematic locus}
\label{section-schematic}


\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-locally-finite-type-dim-zero}
Let $k$ be a field. Let $X$ be an algebraic space over $\Spec(k)$.
If $X$ is locally of finite type over $k$ and has dimension $0$, then $X$
is a scheme.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Let $U$ be an affine scheme and let $U \to X$ be an \'etale morphism.
Set $R = U \times_X U$. Note that the two projection morphisms
$s, t : R \to U$ are \'etale morphisms of schemes. By
Properties of Spaces, Definition \ref{spaces-properties-definition-dimension}
we see that $\dim(U) = 0$ and similarly $\dim(R) = 0$. On the other hand,
the morphism $U \to \Spec(k)$ is locally of finite type as the
composition of the \'etale morphism $U \to X$ and $X \to \Spec(k)$, see
Morphisms of Spaces,
Lemmas \ref{spaces-morphisms-lemma-composition-finite-type} and
\ref{spaces-morphisms-lemma-etale-locally-finite-type}.
Similarly, $R \to \Spec(k)$ is locally of finite type.
Hence by
Varieties, Lemma \ref{varieties-lemma-algebraic-scheme-dim-0}
we see that $U$ and $R$ are disjoint unions of spectra of
local Artinian $k$-algebras $A$ finite over $k$. In particular, as
$$
R = U \times_X U \longrightarrow U \times_{\Spec(k)} U
$$
is a monomorphism, we see that $R$ is a finite union of spectra of
finite $k$-algebras. It follows that $R$ is affine, see
Schemes, Lemma \ref{schemes-lemma-disjoint-union-affines}.
Applying
Varieties, Lemma \ref{varieties-lemma-algebraic-scheme-dim-0}
once more we see that $R$ is finite over $k$. Hence $s, t$
are finite, see
Morphisms, Lemma \ref{morphisms-lemma-finite-permanence}.
Thus
Groupoids, Proposition \ref{groupoids-proposition-finite-flat-equivalence}
shows that the open subspace $U/R$ of $X$ is an affine scheme. Since the
schematic locus of $X$ is an open subspace (see
Properties of Spaces, Lemma \ref{spaces-properties-lemma-subscheme}),
and since $U \to X$ was an arbitrary \'etale morphism from an affine scheme
we conclude that $X$ is a scheme.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-locally-quasi-finite-over-field}
Let $k$ be a field. Let $X$ be an algebraic space over $k$.
The following are equivalent
\begin{enumerate}
\item $X$ is locally quasi-finite over $k$,
\item $X$ is locally of finite type over $k$ and has dimension $0$,
\item $X$ is a scheme and is locally quasi-finite over $k$,
\item $X$ is a scheme and is locally of finite type over $k$ and has
dimension $0$, and
\item $X$ is a disjoint union of spectra of Artinian local $k$-algebras
$A$ over $k$ with $\dim_k(A) < \infty$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Because we are over a field relative dimension of $X/k$ is the same as
the dimension of $X$. Hence by
Morphisms of Spaces,
Lemma \ref{spaces-morphisms-lemma-locally-quasi-finite-rel-dimension-0}
we see that (1) and (2) are equivalent. Hence it follows from
Lemma \ref{lemma-locally-finite-type-dim-zero}
(and trivial implications) that (1) -- (4) are equivalent.
Finally,
Varieties, Lemma \ref{varieties-lemma-algebraic-scheme-dim-0}
shows that (1) -- (4) are equivalent with (5).
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-mono-towards-locally-quasi-finite-over-field}
Let $k$ be a field. Let $f : X \to Y$ be a monomorphism of algebraic spaces
over $k$. If $Y$ is locally quasi-finite over $k$ so is $X$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Assume $Y$ is locally quasi-finite over $k$. By
Lemma \ref{lemma-locally-quasi-finite-over-field}
we see that $Y = \coprod \Spec(A_i)$ where each $A_i$ is an
Artinian local ring finite over $k$. By
Decent Spaces, Lemma
\ref{decent-spaces-lemma-monomorphism-toward-disjoint-union-dim-0-rings}
we see that $X$ is a scheme. Consider $X_i = f^{-1}(\Spec(A_i))$.
Then $X_i$ has either one or zero points. If $X_i$ has zero points there
is nothing to prove. If $X_i$ has one point, then
$X_i = \Spec(B_i)$ with $B_i$ a zero dimensional local ring
and $A_i \to B_i$ is an epimorphism of rings. In particular
$A_i/\mathfrak m_{A_i} = B_i/\mathfrak m_{A_i}B_i$ and we see that
$A_i \to B_i$ is surjective by Nakayama's lemma,
Algebra, Lemma \ref{algebra-lemma-NAK}
(because $\mathfrak m_{A_i}$ is a nilpotent ideal!).
Thus $B_i$ is a finite local $k$-algebra, and we conclude by
Lemma \ref{lemma-locally-quasi-finite-over-field}
that $X \to \Spec(k)$ is locally quasi-finite.
\end{proof}







\section{Geometrically connected algebraic spaces}
\label{section-geometrically-connected}

\noindent
If $X$ is a connected algebraic space over a field, then it can happen that
$X$ becomes disconnected after extending the ground field. This does not
happen for geometrically connected schemes.

\begin{definition}
\label{definition-geometrically-connected}
Let $X$ be an algebraic space over the field $k$. We say $X$ is
{\it geometrically connected} over $k$ if the base change $X_{k'}$
is connected for every field extension $k'$ of $k$.
\end{definition}

\noindent
By convention a connected topological space is nonempty; hence a fortiori
geometrically connected algebraic spaces are nonempty.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-geometrically-connected-check-after-extension}
Let $X$ be an algebraic space over the field $k$.
Let $k \subset k'$ be a field extension.
Then $X$ is geometrically connected over $k$ if and only if
$X_{k'}$ is geometrically connected over $k'$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
If $X$ is geometrically connected over $k$, then it is clear that
$X_{k'}$ is geometrically connected over $k'$. For the converse, note
that for any field extension $k \subset k''$ there exists a common
field extension $k' \subset k'''$ and $k'' \subset k'''$. As the
morphism $X_{k'''} \to X_{k''}$ is surjective (as a base change of
a surjective morphism between spectra of fields) we see that the
connectedness of $X_{k'''}$ implies the connectedness of $X_{k''}$.
Thus if $X_{k'}$ is geometrically connected over $k'$ then
$X$ is geometrically connected over $k$.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-bijection-connected-components}
Let $k$ be a field. Let $X$, $Y$ be algebraic spaces over $k$.
Assume $X$ is geometrically connected over $k$.
Then the projection morphism
$$
p : X \times_k Y \longrightarrow Y
$$
induces a bijection between connected components.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Let $y \in |Y|$ be represented by a morphism $\Spec(K) \to Y$ be a morphism
where $K$ is a field. The fibre of $|X \times_k Y| \to |Y|$ over $y$
is the image of $|Y_K| \to |X \times_k Y|$ by
Properties of Spaces, Lemma \ref{spaces-properties-lemma-points-cartesian}.
Thus these fibres are connected by our assumption that $Y$ is
geometrically connected. By
Morphisms of Spaces, Lemma
\ref{spaces-morphisms-lemma-space-over-field-universally-open}
the map $|p|$ is open.
Thus we may apply Topology,
Lemma \ref{topology-lemma-connected-fibres-connected-components}
to conclude.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-separably-closed-field-connected-components}
Let $k \subset k'$ be an extension of fields. Let $X$ be an algebraic space
over $k$. Assume $k$ separably algebraically closed. Then the morphism
$X_{k'} \to X$ induces a bijection of connected components. In particular,
$X$ is geometrically connected over $k$ if and only if $X$ is connected.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Since $k$ is separably algebraically closed we see that
$k'$ is geometrically connected over $k$, see
Algebra,
Lemma \ref{algebra-lemma-separably-closed-connected-implies-geometric}.
Hence $Z = \Spec(k')$ is geometrically connected over $k$ by
Varieties, Lemma \ref{varieties-lemma-affine-geometrically-connected}.
Since $X_{k'} = Z \times_k X$ the result is a special case of
Lemma \ref{lemma-bijection-connected-components}.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-characterize-geometrically-connected}
Let $k$ be a field. Let $X$ be an algebraic space over $k$.
Let $\overline{k}$ be a separable algebraic closure of $k$.
Then $X$ is geometrically connected if and only if the base change
$X_{\overline{k}}$ is connected.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Assume $X_{\overline{k}}$ is connected. Let $k \subset k'$ be a field
extension. There exists a field extension $\overline{k} \subset \overline{k}'$
such that $k'$ embeds into $\overline{k}'$ as an extension of $k$.
By Lemma \ref{lemma-separably-closed-field-connected-components}
we see that $X_{\overline{k}'}$ is connected.
Since $X_{\overline{k}'} \to X_{k'}$ is surjective we conclude
that $X_{k'}$ is connected as desired.
\end{proof}

\noindent
Let $k$ be a field. Let $k \subset \overline{k}$ be a (possibly infinite)
Galois extension. For example $\overline{k}$ could be the
separable algebraic closure of $k$.
For any $\sigma \in \text{Gal}(\overline{k}/k)$ we get a corresponding
automorphism
$
\Spec(\sigma) :
\Spec(\overline{k})
\longrightarrow
\Spec(\overline{k})
$.
Note that
$\Spec(\sigma) \circ \Spec(\tau) = \Spec(\tau \circ \sigma)$.
Hence we get an action
$$
\text{Gal}(\overline{k}/k)^{opp} \times \Spec(\overline{k})
\longrightarrow
\Spec(\overline{k})
$$
of the opposite group on the scheme $\Spec(\overline{k})$.
Let $X$ be an algebraic space over $k$. Since
$X_{\overline{k}} =
\Spec(\overline{k}) \times_{\Spec(k)} X$
by definition we see that the action above induces a canonical action
\begin{equation}
\label{equation-galois-action-base-change-kbar}
\text{Gal}(\overline{k}/k)^{opp} \times X_{\overline{k}}
\longrightarrow
X_{\overline{k}}.
\end{equation}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-Galois-action-quasi-compact-open}
Let $k$ be a field. Let $X$ be an algebraic space over $k$.
Let $\overline{k}$ be a (possibly infinite) Galois extension of $k$.
Let $V \subset X_{\overline{k}}$ be a quasi-compact open.
Then
\begin{enumerate}
\item there exists a finite subextension $k \subset k' \subset \overline{k}$
and a quasi-compact open $V' \subset X_{k'}$ such that
$V = (V')_{\overline{k}}$,
\item there exists an open subgroup $H \subset \text{Gal}(\overline{k}/k)$
such that $\sigma(V) = V$ for all $\sigma \in H$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Choose a scheme $U$ and a surjective \'etale morphism $U \to X$.
Choose a quasi-compact open $W \subset U_{\overline{k}}$ whose
image in $X_{\overline{k}}$ is $V$. This is possible because
$|U_{\overline{k}}| \to |X_{\overline{k}}|$ is continuous and because
$|U_{\overline{k}}|$ has a basis of quasi-compact opens. We can apply
Varieties, Lemma
\ref{varieties-lemma-Galois-action-quasi-compact-open}
to $W \subset U_{\overline{k}}$ to obtain the lemma.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-closed-fixed-by-Galois}
Let $k$ be a field. Let $k \subset \overline{k}$ be a (possibly infinite)
Galois extension. Let $X$ be an algebraic space over $k$. Let
$\overline{T} \subset |X_{\overline{k}}|$ have the following properties
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\overline{T}$ is a closed subset of $|X_{\overline{k}}|$,
\item for every $\sigma \in \text{Gal}(\overline{k}/k)$
we have $\sigma(\overline{T}) = \overline{T}$.
\end{enumerate}
Then there exists a closed subset $T \subset |X|$ whose inverse image
in $|X_{k'}|$ is $\overline{T}$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Let $T \subset |X|$ be the image of $\overline{T}$.
Since $|X_{\overline{k}}| \to |X|$ is surjective, the statement means
that $T$ is closed and that its inverse image is $\overline{T}$.
Choose a scheme $U$ and a surjective \'etale morphism $U \to X$.
By the case of schemes
(see Varieties, Lemma \ref{varieties-lemma-closed-fixed-by-Galois})
there exists a closed subset $T' \subset |U|$ whose inverse image
in $|U_{\overline{k}}|$ is the inverse image of $\overline{T}$.
Since $|U_{\overline{k}}| \to |X_{\overline{k}}|$ is surjective,
we see that $T'$ is the inverse image of $T$ via $|U| \to |X|$.
By our construction of the topology on $|X|$ this means that $T$ is
closed. In the same manner one sees that $\overline{T}$ is the inverse
image of $T$.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-characterize-geometrically-disconnected}
Let $k$ be a field. Let $X$ be an algebraic space over $k$.
The following are equivalent
\begin{enumerate}
\item $X$ is geometrically connected,
\item for every finite separable field extension $k \subset k'$
the scheme $X_{k'}$ is connected.
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
This proof is identical to the proof of
Varieties, Lemma \ref{varieties-lemma-characterize-geometrically-disconnected}
except that
we replace
Varieties, Lemma \ref{varieties-lemma-characterize-geometrically-connected}
by Lemma \ref{lemma-characterize-geometrically-connected},
we replace
Varieties, Lemma \ref{varieties-lemma-Galois-action-quasi-compact-open}
by Lemma \ref{lemma-Galois-action-quasi-compact-open}, and
we replace
Varieties, Lemma \ref{varieties-lemma-closed-fixed-by-Galois}
by Lemma \ref{lemma-closed-fixed-by-Galois}.
We urge the reader to read that proof in stead of this one.

\medskip\noindent
It follows immediately from the definition that (1) implies (2).
Assume that $X$ is not geometrically connected.
Let $k \subset \overline{k}$ be a separable algebraic
closure of $k$. By
Lemma \ref{lemma-characterize-geometrically-connected}
it follows that $X_{\overline{k}}$ is disconnected.
Say $X_{\overline{k}} = \overline{U} \amalg \overline{V}$
with $\overline{U}$ and $\overline{V}$ open, closed, and nonempty
algebraic subspaces of $X_{\overline{k}}$.

\medskip\noindent
Suppose that $W \subset X$ is any quasi-compact open subspace.
Then $W_{\overline{k}} \cap \overline{U}$ and
$W_{\overline{k}} \cap \overline{V}$ are open and closed subspaces of
$W_{\overline{k}}$. In particular $W_{\overline{k}} \cap \overline{U}$ and
$W_{\overline{k}} \cap \overline{V}$ are quasi-compact, and by
Lemma \ref{lemma-Galois-action-quasi-compact-open}
both $W_{\overline{k}} \cap \overline{U}$ and
$W_{\overline{k}} \cap \overline{V}$
are defined over a finite subextension and invariant under an
open subgroup of $\text{Gal}(\overline{k}/k)$.
We will use this without further mention in the following.

\medskip\noindent
Pick $W_0 \subset X$ quasi-compact open subspace such that both
$W_{0, \overline{k}} \cap \overline{U}$ and
$W_{0, \overline{k}} \cap \overline{V}$ are nonempty.
Choose a finite subextension $k \subset k' \subset \overline{k}$
and a decomposition $W_{0, k'} = U_0' \amalg V_0'$ into open and closed
subsets such that
$W_{0, \overline{k}} \cap \overline{U} = (U'_0)_{\overline{k}}$ and
$W_{0, \overline{k}} \cap \overline{V} = (V'_0)_{\overline{k}}$.
Let $H = \text{Gal}(\overline{k}/k') \subset \text{Gal}(\overline{k}/k)$.
In particular
$\sigma(W_{0, \overline{k}} \cap \overline{U}) =
W_{0, \overline{k}} \cap \overline{U}$ and similarly for
$\overline{V}$.

\medskip\noindent
Having chosen $W_0$, $k'$ as above, for every quasi-compact open subspace
$W \subset X$ we set
$$
U_W =
\bigcap\nolimits_{\sigma \in H} \sigma(W_{\overline{k}} \cap \overline{U}),
\quad
V_W =
\bigcup\nolimits_{\sigma \in H} \sigma(W_{\overline{k}} \cap \overline{V}).
$$
Now, since $W_{\overline{k}} \cap \overline{U}$ and
$W_{\overline{k}} \cap \overline{V}$ are fixed by an open subgroup of
$\text{Gal}(\overline{k}/k)$ we see that the union and intersection
above are finite. Hence $U_W$ and $V_W$ are both open and closed subspaces.
Also, by construction $W_{\bar k} = U_W \amalg V_W$.

\medskip\noindent
We claim that if $W \subset W' \subset X$ are quasi-compact
open subspaces, then $W_{\overline{k}} \cap U_{W'} = U_W$ and
$W_{\overline{k}} \cap V_{W'} = V_W$. Verification omitted.
Hence we see that upon defining $U = \bigcup_{W \subset X} U_W$
and $V = \bigcup_{W \subset X} V_W$ we obtain
$X_{\overline{k}} = U \amalg V$ is a disjoint union of open
and closed subsets.
It is clear that $V$ is nonempty as it is constructed by taking
unions (locally). On the other hand, $U$ is nonempty since it contains
$W_0 \cap \overline{U}$ by construction. Finally, $U, V \subset X_{\bar k}$
are closed and $H$-invariant by construction. Hence by
Lemma \ref{lemma-closed-fixed-by-Galois}
we have $U = (U')_{\bar k}$, and $V = (V')_{\bar k}$ for some
closed $U', V' \subset X_{k'}$. Clearly $X_{k'} = U' \amalg V'$
and we see that $X_{k'}$ is disconnected as desired.
\end{proof}









\section{Spaces smooth over fields}
\label{section-smooth}



\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-smooth-regular}
Let $k$ be a field.
Let $X$ be an algebraic space smooth over $k$.
Then $X$ is a regular algebraic space.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Choose a scheme $U$ and a surjective \'etale morphism $U \to X$.
The morphism $U \to \Spec(k)$ is smooth as a composition of
an \'etale (hence smooth) morphism and a smooth morphism (see
Morphisms of Spaces, Lemmas \ref{spaces-morphisms-lemma-etale-smooth}
and \ref{spaces-morphisms-lemma-composition-smooth}).
Hence $U$ is regular by
Varieties, Lemma \ref{varieties-lemma-smooth-regular}.
By
Properties of Spaces, Definition
\ref{spaces-properties-definition-type-property}
this means that $X$ is regular.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-smooth-separable-closed-points-dense}
Let $k$ be a field. Let $X$ be an algebraic space smooth over $\Spec(k)$.
The set of $x \in |X|$ which are image of morphisms $\Spec(k') \to X$
with $k' \supset k$ finite separable is dense in $|X|$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Choose a scheme $U$ and a surjective \'etale morphism $U \to X$.
The morphism $U \to \Spec(k)$ is smooth as a composition of
an \'etale (hence smooth) morphism and a smooth morphism (see
Morphisms of Spaces, Lemmas \ref{spaces-morphisms-lemma-etale-smooth}
and \ref{spaces-morphisms-lemma-composition-smooth}).
Hence we can apply Varieties, Lemma
\ref{varieties-lemma-smooth-separable-closed-points-dense} to see that
the closed points of $U$ whose residue fields are finite separable over
$k$ are dense. This implies the lemma by our definition of the
topology on $|X|$.
\end{proof}
