\noindent
This chapter is the analogue of the chapter on varieties in the setting
of algebraic spaces. A reference for algebraic spaces is
\cite{K}.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-minimal-primes-tensor-strictly-henselian}
Let $k$ be an algebraically closed field. Let $A$, $B$ be strictly
henselian local $k$-algebras with residue field equal to $k$.
Let $C$ be the strict henselization of $A \otimes_k B$ at the maximal
ideal $\mathfrak m_A \otimes_k B + A \otimes_k \mathfrak m_B$.
Then the minimal primes of $C$ correspond $1$-to-$1$ to pairs of
minimal primes of $A$ and $B$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
First note that a minimal prime $\mathfrak r$ of $C$ maps to a minimal
prime $\mathfrak p$ in $A$ and to a minimal prime $\mathfrak q$ of $B$
because the ring maps $A \to C$ and $B \to C$ are flat (by going down for
flat ring map
Algebra, Lemma \ref{algebra-lemma-flat-going-down}).
Hence it suffices to show that the strict henselization of
$(A/\mathfrak p \otimes_k B/\mathfrak q)_{
\mathfrak m_A \otimes_k B + A \otimes_k \mathfrak m_B}$
has a unique minimal prime ideal. By
Algebra, Lemma \ref{algebra-lemma-quotient-strict-henselization}
the rings $A/\mathfrak p$, $B/\mathfrak q$ are strictly henselian.
Hence we may assume that $A$ and $B$ are strictly henselian
local domains and our goal is to show that $C$ has a unique minimal prime. By
Properties of Spaces,
Lemma \ref{spaces-properties-lemma-geometrically-unibranch}.
we see that the integral closure $A'$ of $A$ in its fraction field
is a normal local domain with residue field $k$ and similarly for the
integral closure $B'$ of $B$ into its fraction field. By
Algebra, Lemma \ref{algebra-lemma-geometrically-normal-tensor-normal}
we see that $A' \otimes_k B'$ is a normal ring. Hence its localization
$$
R = (A' \otimes_k B')_{
\mathfrak m_{A'} \otimes_k B' + A' \otimes_k \mathfrak m_{B'}}
$$
is a normal local domain. Note that $A \otimes_k B \to A' \otimes_k B'$
is integral (hence gong up holds --
Algebra, Lemmma \ref{algebra-lemma-integral-going-up})
and that $\mathfrak m_{A'} \otimes_k B' + A' \otimes_k \mathfrak m_{B'}$
is the unique maximal ideal of $A' \otimes_k B'$
lying over $\mathfrak m_A \otimes_k B + A \otimes_k \mathfrak m_B$.
Hence we see that
$$
R = (A' \otimes_k B')_{
\mathfrak m_A \otimes_k B + A \otimes_k \mathfrak m_B}
$$
by
Algebra, Lemma \ref{algebra-lemma-unique-prime-over-localize-below}.
It follows that
$$
(A \otimes_k B)_{
\mathfrak m_A \otimes_k B + A \otimes_k \mathfrak m_B}
\longrightarrow
R
$$
is integral. We conclude that $R$ is the integral closure of
$(A \otimes_k B)_{
\mathfrak m_A \otimes_k B + A \otimes_k \mathfrak m_B}$
in its fraction field, and by
Properties of Spaces,
Lemma \ref{spaces-properties-lemma-geometrically-unibranch}
once again we conclude that $C$ has a unique prime ideal.
\end{proof}
