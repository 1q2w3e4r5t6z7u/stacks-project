\section{Introduction}
\label{section-introduction}

\noindent
In this chapter we continue our study of properties of morphisms of algebraic
spaces. A fundamental reference is \cite{Kn}.





\section{Conventions}
\label{section-conventions}

\noindent
The standing assumption is that all schemes are contained in
a big fppf site $\textit{Sch}_{fppf}$. And all rings $A$ considered
have the property that $\text{Spec}(A)$ is (isomorphic) to an
object of this big site.

\medskip\noindent
Let $S$ be a scheme and let $X$ be an algebraic space over $S$.
In this chapter and the following we will write $X \times_S X$
for the product of $X$ with itself (in the category of algebraic
spaces over $S$), instead of $X \times X$.




\section{Morphisms of finite presentation}
\label{section-finite-presentation}

\noindent
In this section we generalize
Limits, Proposition
\ref{limits-proposition-characterize-locally-finite-presentation}
to morphisms of algebraic spaces.
The motivation for the following definition comes from
the proposition just cited.

\begin{definition}
\label{definition-finite-presentation}
Let $S$ be a scheme.
\begin{enumerate}
\item A functor $F : (\textit{Sch}/S)_{fppf}^{opp} \to \textit{Sets}$
is said to be {\it locally of finite presentation} if 
for every affine scheme $T$ over $S$ which is a limit $T = \text{lim}\ T_i$
of a directed inverse system of affine schemes $T_i$ over $S$, we have
$$
F(T) = \text{colim}\ F(T_i).
$$
We sometimes say that $F$ is {\it locally of finite presentation over $S$}.
\item Let $F, G : (\textit{Sch}/S)_{fppf}^{opp} \to \textit{Sets}$.
A transformation of functors $a : F \to G$
is {\it locally of finite presentation} if for every scheme $T$ over $S$
and every $y \in G(T)$ the functor
$$
F_y : (\textit{Sch}/T)_{fppf}^{opp} \longrightarrow \textit{Sets}, \quad
T'/T \longmapsto \{x \in F(T') \mid a(x) = y|_{T'}\}
$$
is locally of finite presentation over $T$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

\noindent
The functor $F_y$ is in some sense the fiber of $a : F \to G$ over $y$.
Of course it is just the fiber product $F \times_{G, y} T$ seen as
a functor on $(\textit{Sch}/T)_{fppf}$.

\medskip\noindent
At this point we temporarily have two definitions of what it means
for a morphism $X \to Y$ of algebraic spaces over $S$ to be locally of finite
presentation. Namely, one by
Morphisms of Spaces,
Definition \ref{spaces-morphisms-definition-locally-finite-presentation}
and one using that $X$ and $Y$ are functors. We will show below
(insert future reference here)
that these two definitions agree.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-composition-locally-finite-presentation}
Let $S$ be a scheme contained in $\textit{Sch}_{fppf}$.
Let $F, G, H : (\textit{Sch}/S)_{fppf}^{opp} \to \textit{Sets}$.
Let $a : F \to G$, $b : G \to H$ be transformations of functors.
If $a$ and $b$ are locally of finite presentation, then
$$
b \circ a : F \longrightarrow H
$$
is locally of finite presentation.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Let $T$ be a scheme over $S$. Let $z \in H(T)$.
We have to show that $F_z$ (notation as in
Definition \ref{definition-finite-presentation}
is locally of finite presentation over $T$.
Let $T'$ be an affine scheme over $T$.
Suppose that $T' = \text{lim}\ T'_i$ is written as a limit of
a directed inverse system of affine schemes over $T$.
Finally, let $x \in F(T')$ with $b(a(x)) = z|_{T'}$.
By assumption on $b$ there exists an index $i$ and an
element $y_i \in G(T'_i)$ with $b(y_i) = z|_{T'_i}$ and
$y_i|_{T'} = a(x)$.
Then, by assumption on $a$, there exists an index $i' \geq i$
and an element $x_{i'} \in F(T'_{i'})$ with $a(x_{i'}) = y_i|_{T'_{i'}}$
and $x_{i'}|_{T'} = x$. It follows that $(b \circ a)(x_{i'}) = z|_{T'_{i'}}$
and $x_{i'}|_{T'} = x$. In this way we see that the map
$\text{colim}\ F_z(T'_i) \to F_z(T')$ is surjective.
We omit the proof of injectivity.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-base-change-locally-finite-presentation}
Let $S$ be a scheme contained in $\textit{Sch}_{fppf}$.
Let $F, G, H : (\textit{Sch}/S)_{fppf}^{opp} \to \textit{Sets}$.
Let $a : F \to G$, $b : H \to G$ be transformations of functors.
Consider the fibre product diagram
$$
\xymatrix{
H \times_{b, G, a} F \ar[r]_-{b'} \ar[d]_{a'} & F \ar[d]^a \\
H \ar[r]^b & G
}
$$
If $a$ is locally of finite presentation, then the base change $a'$ is
locally of finite presentation.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Omitted. Hint: This is formal.
\end{proof}








\section{Formally smooth morphisms}
\label{section-formally-smooth}

\noindent
Michael Artin's position on differential criteria of smoothness (e.g.,
Morphisms, Lemma \ref{morphisms-lemma-smooth-at-point}) is that they are
basically useless (in practice). In this section we introduce the
notion of a formally smooth morphism $X \to Y$. Such a morphism is
characterized by the property that $T$-valued points of $X$ lift
to inifinitesimal thickenings of $T$ provided $T$ is affine.
The main result is that a morphism which is formally smooth and
locally of finite presentation is smooth, see
Lemma \ref{lemma-smooth-formally-smooth}.
It turns out that this criterion is often easier to use than the
differential criteria mentioned above.


\medskip\noindent
Recall that a ring map $R \to A$ is called {\it formally smooth}
(see Algebra, Definition \ref{algebra-definition-formally-smooth})
if for every commutative solid diagram
$$
\xymatrix{
A \ar[r] \ar@{-->}[rd] & B/I \\
R \ar[r] \ar[u] & B \ar[u]
}
$$
where $I \subset B$ is an ideal of square zero, a dotted
arrow exists which makes the diagram commute. This motivates
the following analogue for morphisms of schemes.

\begin{definition}
\label{definition-formally-smooth}
Let $S$ be a scheme.
Let $a : F \to G$ be a transformation of functors
$F, G : (\textit{Sch}/S)_{fppf}^{opp} \to \textit{Sets}$.
We say $a$ is {\it formally smooth} if given any solid commutative diagram
$$
\xymatrix{
F \ar[d]_a & T \ar[d]^i \ar[l] \\
G & T' \ar[l] \ar@{-->}[lu]
}
$$
where $T$ and $T'$ are affine schemes and $i$ is a closed immersion defined
by an ideal of square zero there exists a dotted arrow making the diagram
commute.
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-composition-formally-smooth}
A composition of formally smooth transformations of functors is formally
smooth.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Omitted.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-base-change-formally-smooth}
Let $S$ be a scheme contained in $\textit{Sch}_{fppf}$.
Let $F, G, H : (\textit{Sch}/S)_{fppf}^{opp} \to \textit{Sets}$.
Let $a : F \to G$, $b : H \to G$ be transformations of functors.
Consider the fibre product diagram
$$
\xymatrix{
H \times_{b, G, a} F \ar[r]_-{b'} \ar[d]_{a'} & F \ar[d]^a \\
H \ar[r]^b & G
}
$$
If $a$ is formally smooth, then the base change $a'$ is
formally smooth.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Omitted, but see Algebra, Lemma \ref{algebra-lemma-base-change-fs}
for the algebraic version.
\end{proof}
