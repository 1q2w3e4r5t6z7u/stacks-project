\section{Introduction}
\label{section-introduction}

\noindent
In this chapter we continue our study of properties of morphisms of algebraic
spaces. A fundamental reference is \cite{Kn}.





\section{Conventions}
\label{section-conventions}

\noindent
The standing assumption is that all schemes are contained in
a big fppf site $\textit{Sch}_{fppf}$. And all rings $A$ considered
have the property that $\text{Spec}(A)$ is (isomorphic) to an
object of this big site.

\medskip\noindent
Let $S$ be a scheme and let $X$ be an algebraic space over $S$.
In this chapter and the following we will write $X \times_S X$
for the product of $X$ with itself (in the category of algebraic
spaces over $S$), instead of $X \times X$.




\section{Morphisms of finite presentation}
\label{section-finite-presentation}

\noindent
In this section we generalize
Limits, Proposition
\ref{limits-proposition-characterize-locally-finite-presentation}
to morphisms of algebraic spaces.
The motivation for the following definition comes from
the proposition just cited.

\begin{definition}
\label{definition-locally-finite-presentation}
Let $S$ be a scheme.
\begin{enumerate}
\item A functor $F : (\textit{Sch}/S)_{fppf}^{opp} \to \textit{Sets}$
is said to be {\it locally of finite presentation} or {\it limit preserving} if
for every affine scheme $T$ over $S$ which is a limit $T = \text{lim}\ T_i$
of a directed inverse system of affine schemes $T_i$ over $S$, we have
$$
F(T) = \text{colim}\ F(T_i).
$$
We sometimes say that $F$ is {\it locally of finite presentation over $S$}.
\item Let $F, G : (\textit{Sch}/S)_{fppf}^{opp} \to \textit{Sets}$.
A transformation of functors $a : F \to G$
is {\it locally of finite presentation} if for every scheme $T$ over $S$
and every $y \in G(T)$ the functor
$$
F_y : (\textit{Sch}/T)_{fppf}^{opp} \longrightarrow \textit{Sets}, \quad
T'/T \longmapsto \{x \in F(T') \mid a(x) = y|_{T'}\}
$$
is locally of finite presentation over $T$. We sometimes say that
$F$ is {\it relatively limit preserving} over $G$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

\noindent
The functor $F_y$ of the definition is in some sense the fiber of
$a : F \to G$ over $y$, except that it is a presheaf on the big fppf
site of $T$. A formula for this functor is:
\begin{equation}
\label{equation-fibre-map-functors}
F_y =
F|_{(\textit{Sch}/T)_{fppf}}
{\times}_{G|_{(\textit{Sch}/T)_{fppf}}}
*
\end{equation}
Here $*$ is the final object in the category of (pre)sheaves
on $(\textit{Sch}/T)_{fppf}$ (see
Sites, Example \ref{sites-example-singleton-sheaf})
and the map $* \to G|_{(\textit{Sch}/T)_{fppf}}$ is given by $y$.
Note that if $j : (\textit{Sch}/T)_{fppf} \to (\textit{Sch}/S)_{fppf}$
is the localization functor, then the formula above becomes
$F_y = j^{-1}F \times_{j^{-1}G} *$ and $j_!F_y$ is just the fiber product
$F \times_{G, y} T$. (See
Sites, Section \ref{sites-section-localize},
for information on localization, and especially
Sites, Remark \ref{sites-remark-localize-presheaves}
for information on $j_!$ for presheaves.)

\medskip\noindent
At this point we temporarily have two definitions of what it means
for a morphism $X \to Y$ of algebraic spaces over $S$ to be locally of finite
presentation. Namely, one by
Morphisms of Spaces,
Definition \ref{spaces-morphisms-definition-locally-finite-presentation}
and one using that $X \to Y$ is a transformation of functors so that
Definition \ref{definition-locally-finite-presentation}
applies. We will show in
Proposition \ref{proposition-characterize-locally-finite-presentation}
that these two definitions agree.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-composition-locally-finite-presentation}
Let $S$ be a scheme contained in $\textit{Sch}_{fppf}$.
Let $F, G, H : (\textit{Sch}/S)_{fppf}^{opp} \to \textit{Sets}$.
Let $a : F \to G$, $b : G \to H$ be transformations of functors.
If $a$ and $b$ are locally of finite presentation, then
$$
b \circ a : F \longrightarrow H
$$
is locally of finite presentation.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Let $T$ be a scheme over $S$. Let $z \in H(T)$.
We have to show that $F_z$ (notation as in
Definition \ref{definition-locally-finite-presentation}
is locally of finite presentation over $T$.
Let $T'$ be an affine scheme over $T$.
Suppose that $T' = \text{lim}\ T'_i$ is written as a limit of
a directed inverse system of affine schemes over $T$.
Finally, let $x \in F(T')$ with $b(a(x)) = z|_{T'}$.
By assumption on $b$ there exists an index $i$ and an
element $y_i \in G(T'_i)$ with $b(y_i) = z|_{T'_i}$ and
$y_i|_{T'} = a(x)$.
Then, by assumption on $a$, there exists an index $i' \geq i$
and an element $x_{i'} \in F(T'_{i'})$ with $a(x_{i'}) = y_i|_{T'_{i'}}$
and $x_{i'}|_{T'} = x$. It follows that $(b \circ a)(x_{i'}) = z|_{T'_{i'}}$
and $x_{i'}|_{T'} = x$. In this way we see that the map
$\text{colim}\ F_z(T'_i) \to F_z(T')$ is surjective.
We omit the proof of injectivity.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-base-change-locally-finite-presentation}
Let $S$ be a scheme contained in $\textit{Sch}_{fppf}$.
Let $F, G, H : (\textit{Sch}/S)_{fppf}^{opp} \to \textit{Sets}$.
Let $a : F \to G$, $b : H \to G$ be transformations of functors.
Consider the fibre product diagram
$$
\xymatrix{
H \times_{b, G, a} F \ar[r]_-{b'} \ar[d]_{a'} & F \ar[d]^a \\
H \ar[r]^b & G
}
$$
If $a$ is locally of finite presentation, then the base change $a'$ is
locally of finite presentation.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Omitted. Hint: This is formal.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-limit-fppf-topology}
Let $T$ be an affine scheme which is written as a limit
$T = \text{lim}_{i \in I}\ T_i$ of a directed inverse system of affine schemes.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Let $\mathcal{V} = \{V_j \to T\}_{j = 1, \ldots, m}$ be a standard fppf
covering of $T$, see
Topologies, Definition \ref{topologies-definition-standard-fppf}.
Then there exists an index $i$ and a standard fppf covering
$\mathcal{V}_i = \{V_{i, j} \to T_i\}_{j = 1, \ldots, m}$
whose base change $T \times_{T_i} \mathcal{V}_i$ to $T$
is isomorphic to $\mathcal{V}$.
\item Let $\mathcal{V}_i$, $\mathcal{V}'_i$ be a pair of standard
fppf coverings of $T_i$. If
$f : T \times_{T_i} \mathcal{V} \to T \times_{T_i} \mathcal{V}'_i$ is
a morphism of coverings of $T$, then there exists an index
$i' \geq i$ and a morphism
$f_{i'} : T_{i'} \times_{T_i} \mathcal{V} \to
T_{i'} \times_{T_i} \mathcal{V}'_i$
whose base change to $T$ is $f$.
\item If
$f, g : \mathcal{V} \to \mathcal{V}'_i$
are morphisms of standard fppf coverings of $T_i$ whose
base changes $f_T, g_T$ to $T$ are equal then there exists an
index $i' \geq i$ such that $f_{T_{i'}} = g_{T_{i'}}$.
\end{enumerate}
In other words, the category of standard fppf coverings of $T$ is
the colimit over $I$ of the categories of standard fppf coverings of $T_i$
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
By
Limits, Lemma \ref{limits-lemma-descend-finite-presentation}
the category of schemes of finite presentation over $T$ is the
colimit over $I$ of the categories of finite presentation over $T_i$. By
Limits, Lemmas \ref{limits-lemma-descend-affine-finite-presentation}
and \ref{limits-lemma-descend-flat-finite-presentation}
the same is true for category of schemes which are affine, flat and
of finite presentation over $T$.
To finish the proof of the lemma it suffices to show that if
$\{V_{j, i} \to T_i\}_{j = 1, \ldots, m}$ is a finite family of
flat finitely presented morphisms with $V_{j, i}$ affine, and the
base change $\coprod_j T \times_{T_i} V_{j, i} \to T$ is surjective,
then for some $i' \geq i$ the morphism
$\coprod T_{i'} \times_{T_i} V_{j, i} \to T_{i'}$ is surjective.
Denote $W_{i'} \subset T_{i'}$, resp.\ $W \subset T$ the image.
Of course $W = T$ by assumption.
Since the morphisms are flat and of finite presentation we see that
$W_i$ is a quasi-compact open of $T_i$, see
Morphisms, Lemma \ref{morphisms-lemma-fppf-open}.
Moreover, $W = T \times_{T_i} W_i$ (formation of image commutes
with base change). Hence by
Limits, Lemma \ref{limits-lemma-descend-opens}
we conclude that $W_{i'} = T_{i'}$ for some large enough $i'$
and we win.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-sheafify-finite-presentation}
Let $S$ be a scheme contained in $\textit{Sch}_{fppf}$.
Let $F : (\textit{Sch}/S)_{fppf}^{opp} \to \textit{Sets}$ be a functor.
If $F$ is locally of finite presentation over $S$ then its sheafification
$F^\#$ is locally of finite presentation over $S$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Assume $F$ is locally of finite presentation.
It suffices to show that $F^+$ is locally of finite presentation, since
$F^\# = (F^+)^+$, see
Sites, Theorem \ref{sites-theorem-plus}.
Let $T$ be an affine scheme over $S$, and let $T = \lim T_i$ be written
as the directed limit of an inverse system of affine $S$ schemes.
Recall that $F^+(T)$ is the colimit of $\check H^0(\mathcal{V}, F)$
where the limit is over all coverings of $T$ in $(\textit{Sch}/S)_{fppf}$.
Any fppf covering of an affine scheme can be refined by a standard
fppf covering, see
Topologies, Lemma \ref{topologies-lemma-fppf-affine}.
Hence we can write
$$
F^+(T)
=
\text{colim}_{\mathcal{V}\text{ standard covering }T}\ 
\check H^0(\mathcal{V}, F).
$$
By
Lemma \ref{lemma-limit-fppf-topology}
we may rewrite this as
$$
\text{colim}_{i \in I}\ 
\text{colim}_{\mathcal{V}_i\text{ standard covering }T_i}\ 
\check H^0(T \times_{T_i}\mathcal{V}_i, F).
$$
(The order of the colimits is irrelevant by
Categories, Lemma \ref{categories-lemma-colimits-commute}.)
Given a standard fppf covering
$\mathcal{V}_i = \{V_j \to T_i\}_{j = 1, \ldots, m}$ of $T_i$ we see that
$$
T \times_{T_i} V_j = \text{lim}_{i' \geq i}\ T_{i'} \times_T V_j
$$
by 
Limits, Lemma \ref{limits-lemma-scheme-over-limit}, and similarly
$$
T \times_{T_i} (V_j \times_{T_i} V_{j'}) =
\text{lim}_{i' \geq i}\ T_{i'} \times_T (V_j \times_{T_i} V_{j'}).
$$
As the presheaf $F$ is locally of finite presentation this means that
$$
\check H^0(T \times_{T_i}\mathcal{V}_i, F)
=
\text{colim}_{i' \geq i}
\check H^0(T_{i'} \times_{T_i}\mathcal{V}_i, F).
$$
Hence the colimit expression for $F^+(T)$ above collapses to
$$
\text{colim}_{i \in I}\ 
\text{colim}_{\mathcal{V}\text{ standard covering }T_i}\ 
\check H^0(\mathcal{V}, F).
=
\text{colim}_{i \in I} F^+(T_i).
$$
In other words $F^+(T) = \text{colim}_i\ F^+(T_i)$ and hence
the lemma holds.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-sheaf-finite-presentation}
Let $S$ be a scheme. 
Let $F : (\textit{Sch}/S)_{fppf}^{opp} \to \textit{Sets}$ be a functor.
Assume that
\begin{enumerate}
\item $F$ is a sheaf, and
\item there exists an fppf covering $\{U_j \to S\}_{j \in J}$ such that
$F|_{(\textit{Sch}/U_j)_{fppf}}$ is locally of finite presentation.
\end{enumerate}
Then $F$ is locally of finite presentation.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Let $T$ be an affine scheme over $S$.
Let $I$ be a directed partially ordered set, and let
$T_i$ be an inverse system of affine schemes over $S$ such that
$T = \text{lim}\ T_i$. We have to show that the canonical
map $\text{colim}\ F(T_i) \to F(T)$ is bijective.

\medskip\noindent
Choose some $0 \in I$ and choose a standard fppf covering
$\{V_{0, k} \to T_{0}\}_{k = 1, \ldots, m}$ which refines
the pullback $\{U_j \times_S T_0 \to T_0\}$ of the given fppf covering of $S$.
For each $i \geq 0$ we set $V_{i, k} = T_i \times_{T_0} V_{0, k}$, and
we set $V_k = T \times_{T_0} V_{0, k}$. Note that
$V_k = \text{lim}_{i \geq 0}\ V_{i, k}$, see
Limits, Lemma \ref{limits-lemma-scheme-over-limit}.

\medskip\noindent
Suppose that $x, x' \in \text{colim}\ F(T_i)$ map to the same
element of $F(T)$. Say $x, x'$ are given by elements $x_i, x'_i \in F(T_i)$
for some $i \in I$ (we may choose the same $i$ for both as $I$ is directed).
By assumption (2) and the fact that $x_i, x'_i$ map to the same element
of $F(T)$ this implies that
$$
x_i|_{V_{i', k}} = x'_i|_{V_{i', k}}
$$
for some suitably large $i' \in I$. We can choose the same $i'$ for each
$k$ as $k \in \{1, \ldots, m\}$ ranges over a finite set.
Since $\{V_{i', k} \to T_{i'}\}$
is an fppf covering and $F$ is a sheaf this implies that
$x_i|_{T_{i'}} = x'_i|_{T_{i'}}$ as desired. This proves that the map
$\text{colim}\ F(T_i) \to F(T)$ is injective.

\medskip\noindent
To show surjectivity we argue in a similar fashion.
Let $x \in F(T)$. By assumption (2) for each $k$ we
can choose a $i$ such that $x|_{V_k}$ comes from an
element $x_{i, k} \in F(V_{i, k})$. As before we may choose a
single $i$ which works for all $k$. By the injectivity
proved above we see that
$$
x_{i, k}|_{V_{i', k} \times_{T_{i'}} V_{i', l}}
=
x_{i, l}|_{V_{i', k} \times_{T_{i'}} V_{i', l}}
$$
for some large enough $i'$. Hence by the sheaf condition of $F$
the elements $x_{i, k}|_{V_{i', k}}$ glue to an element $x_{i'} \in F(T_{i'})$
as desired.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-sheafify-finite-presentation-map}
Let $S$ be a scheme contained in $\textit{Sch}_{fppf}$.
Let $F, G : (\textit{Sch}/S)_{fppf}^{opp} \to \textit{Sets}$ be functors.
If $a : F \to G$ is a transformation which is locally of finite
presentation, then the induced transformation of sheaves
$F^\# \to G^\#$ is of finite presentation.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Suppose that $T$ is a scheme and $y \in G^\#(T)$.
We have to show the functor
$F^\#_y : (\textit{Sch}/T)_{fppf}^{opp} \to \textit{Sets}$
constructed from $F^\# \to G^\#$ and $y$ as in
Definition \ref{definition-locally-finite-presentation}
is locally of finite presentation.
By Equation (\ref{equation-fibre-map-functors})
we see that $F^\#_y$ is a sheaf. Choose an fppf covering
$\{V_j \to T\}_{j \in J}$ such that $y|_{V_j}$ comes from
an element $y_j \in F(V_j)$.
Note that the restriction of $F^\#$ to $(\textit{Sch}/V_j)_{fppf}$
is just $F^\#_{y_j}$. If we can show that $F^\#_{y_j}$ is
locally of finite presentation then
Lemma \ref{lemma-sheaf-finite-presentation}
garantees that $F^\#_y$ is locally of finite presentation and
we win. This reduces us to the case $y \in G(T)$.

\medskip\noindent
Let $y \in G(T)$. In this case we claim that $F^\#_y = (F_y)^\#$.
This follows from 
Equation (\ref{equation-fibre-map-functors}).
Thus this case follows from
Lemma \ref{lemma-sheafify-finite-presentation}.
\end{proof}

\begin{proposition}
\label{proposition-characterize-locally-finite-presentation}
Let $S$ be a scheme. Let $f : X \to Y$ be a morphism of algebraic
spaces over $S$. The following are equivalent:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The morphism $f$ is a morphism of algebraic spaces which is
locally of finite presentation, see
Morphisms of Spaces,
Definition \ref{spaces-morphisms-definition-locally-finite-presentation}.
\item The morphism $f : X \to Y$ is locally of finite presentation as
a transformation of functors, see
Definition \ref{definition-locally-finite-presentation}.
\end{enumerate}
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
Assume (1). Let $T$ be a scheme and let $y \in Y(T)$. We have to show that
$T \times_X Y$ is locally of finite presentation over $T$ in the sense of
Definition \ref{definition-locally-finite-presentation}.
Hence we are reduced to proving that if $X$ is an algebraic space which
is locally of finite presentation over $S$ as an algebraic space, then it
is locally of finite presentation as a functor
$X : (\textit{Sch}/S)_{fppf}^{opp} \to \textit{Sets}$.
To see this choose a presentation $X = U/R$, see
Spaces, Definition \ref{spaces-definition-presentation}.
It follows from
Morphisms of Spaces,
Definition \ref{spaces-morphisms-definition-locally-finite-presentation}
that both $U$ and $R$ are schemes which are locally of finite presentation
over $S$. Hence by
Limits, Proposition
\ref{limits-proposition-characterize-locally-finite-presentation}
we have
$$
U(T) = \text{colim}\ U(T_i),\quad
R(T) = \text{colim}\ R(T_i)
$$
whenever $T = \text{lim}_i\ T_i$ in $(\textit{Sch}/S)_{fppf}$. It follows
that the presheaf
$$
(\textit{Sch}/S)_{fppf}^{opp} \longrightarrow \textit{Sets},\quad
W \longmapsto U(W)/R(W)
$$
is locally of finite presentation. Hence by
Lemma \ref{lemma-sheafify-finite-presentation}
its sheafification $X = U/R$ is locally of finite presentation too.

\medskip\noindent
Assume (2). Choose a scheme $V$ and a surjective \'etale morphism
$V \to Y$. Next, choose a scheme $U$ and a surjective \'etale morphism
$U \to V \times_Y X$. By
Lemma \ref{lemma-base-change-locally-finite-presentation}
the transformation of functors $V \times_Y X \to V$ is locally of
finite presentation. By
Morphisms of Spaces,
Lemma \ref{spaces-morphisms-lemma-etale-locally-finite-presentation}
the morphism of algebraic spaces $U \to V \times_Y X$ is locally
of finite presentation, hence locally of finite presentation as
a transformation of functors by the first part of the proof. By
Lemma \ref{lemma-composition-locally-finite-presentation}
the composition $U \to V \times_Y X \to V$ is locally of
finite presentation as a transformation of functors. Hence
the morphism of schemes $U \to V$ is locally of finite presentation by
Limits, Proposition
\ref{limits-proposition-characterize-locally-finite-presentation}
(modulo a set theoretic remark, see last paragraph of the proof).
This means, by definition, that (1) holds.

\medskip\noindent
Set theoretic remark. Let $U \to V$ be a morphism of
$(\textit{Sch}/S)_{fppf}$. In the statement of
Limits, Proposition
\ref{limits-proposition-characterize-locally-finite-presentation}
we characterize $U \to V$ as being locally of finite presentation
if for {\it all} directed inverse systems $(T_i, f_{ii'})$ of affine schemes
over $V$ we have $U(T) = \text{colim}\ V(T_i)$, but in the current setting
we may only consider affine schemes $T_i$ over $V$ which are (isomorphic to)
an object of $(\textit{Sch}/S)_{fppf}$. So we have to make sure that there
are enough affines in $(\textit{Sch}/S)_{fppf}$ to make the proof work.
Inspecting the proof of (2) $\Rightarrow$ (1) of
Limits, Proposition
\ref{limits-proposition-characterize-locally-finite-presentation}
we see that the question reduces to the case that $U$ and $V$ are affine.
Say $U = \text{Spec}(A)$ and $V = \text{Spec}(B)$. By construction
of $(\textit{Sch}/S)_{fppf}$ the spectrum of any ring of cardinality
$\leq |B|$ is isomorphic to an object of $(\textit{Sch}/S)_{fppf}$.
Hence it suffices to observe that in the "only if" part of the proof of
Algebra, Lemma \ref{algebra-lemma-characterize-finite-presentation}
only $A$-algebras of cardinality $\leq |B|$ are used.
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}
\label{remark-limit-preserving}
Here is an important special case of
Proposition \ref{proposition-characterize-locally-finite-presentation}.
Let $S$ be a scheme. Let $X$ be an algebraic space over $S$.
Then $X$ is locally of finite presentation over $S$ if and only
if $X$, as a functor $(\textit{Sch}/S)^{opp} \to \textit{Sets}$,
is limit preserving. Compare with
Limits, Remark \ref{limits-remark-limit-preserving}.
\end{remark}











\section{Conormal sheaf of an immersion}
\label{section-conormal-sheaf}

\noindent
Let $S$ be a scheme. Let $i : Z \to X$ be a closed immersion of algebraic
spaces over $S$. Let $\mathcal{I} \subset \mathcal{O}_X$ be the corresponding
quasi-coherent sheaf of ideals, see
Morphisms of Spaces,
Lemma \ref{spaces-morphisms-lemma-closed-immersion-ideals}.
Consider the short exact sequence
$$
0 \to \mathcal{I}^2 \to \mathcal{I} \to \mathcal{I}/\mathcal{I}^2 \to 0
$$
of quasi-coherent sheaves on $X$. Since the sheaf $\mathcal{I}/\mathcal{I}^2$
is annihilated by $\mathcal{I}$ it corresponds to a sheaf on $Z$ by
Morphisms of Spaces, Lemma \ref{spaces-morphisms-lemma-i-star-equivalence}.
This sheaf is often simply denoted $\mathcal{I}/\mathcal{I}^2$ by the abuse
of notation mentioned in
Morphisms of Spaces,
Section \ref{spaces-morphisms-section-closed-immersions-quasi-coherent}.

\medskip\noindent
In case $i : Z \to X$ is a (locally closed) immersion we define the
conormal sheaf of $i$ as the conormal sheaf of the closed
immersion $i : Z \to X \setminus \partial Z$, where
$\partial Z = \overline{Z} \setminus Z$. It is often denoted
$\mathcal{I}/\mathcal{I}^2$ where $\mathcal{I}$ is the ideal sheaf
of the closed immersion $i : Z \to X \setminus \partial Z$.

\begin{definition}
\label{definition-conormal-sheaf}
Let $i : Z \to X$ be an immersion. The {\it conormal sheaf
$\mathcal{C}_{Z/X}$ of $Z$ in $X$} or the {\it conormal sheaf of $i$}
is the quasi-coherent $\mathcal{O}_Z$-module $\mathcal{I}/\mathcal{I}^2$
described above.
\end{definition}

\noindent
In \cite[IV Definition 16.1.2]{EGA} this sheaf is denoted
$\mathcal{N}_{Z/X}$. We will not follow this convention since we would
like to reserve the notation $\mathcal{N}_{Z/X}$
for the {\it normal sheaf of the immersion}. It is defined as
$$
\mathcal{N}_{Z/X} =
\textit{Hom}_{\mathcal{O}_Z}(\mathcal{C}_{Z/X}, \mathcal{O}_Z) =
\textit{Hom}_{\mathcal{O}_Z}(\mathcal{I}/\mathcal{I}^2, \mathcal{O}_Z)
$$
provided the conormal sheaf is of finite presentation (otherwise the
normal sheaf may not even be quasi-coherent). We will come back to the
normal sheaf later (insert future reference here).

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-etale-conormal}
Let $S$ be a scheme. Let $i : Z \to X$ be an immersion.
Let $\varphi : U \to X$ be an \'etale morphism where $U$ is a scheme.
Set $Z_U = U \times_X Z$ which is a locally closed subscheme of $U$.
Then
$$
\mathcal{C}_{Z/X}|_U = \mathcal{C}_{Z_U/U}
$$
canonically and functorially in $U$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Let $T \subset X$ be a closed subspace such that $i$ defines a closed
immersion into $X \setminus T$.
Let $\mathcal{I}$ be the quasi-coherent sheaf of ideals on
$X \setminus T$ defining $Z$. Then the lemma just states that
$\mathcal{I}|_{U \setminus \varphi^{-1}(T)}$ is the sheaf of ideals of
the immersion $Z' \to U \setminus \varphi^{-1}(T)$.
This is clear from the construction of $\mathcal{I}$ in
Morphisms of Spaces, Lemma \ref{spaces-morphisms-lemma-closed-immersion-ideals}.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-conormal-functorial}
Let $S$ be a scheme. Let
$$
\xymatrix{
Z \ar[r]_i \ar[d]_f & X \ar[d]^g \\
Z' \ar[r]^{i'} & X'
}
$$
be a commutative diagram of algebraic spaces over $S$.
Assume $i$, $i'$ immersions. There is a canonical map
of $\mathcal{O}_Z$-modules
$$
f^*\mathcal{C}_{Z'/X'}
\longrightarrow
\mathcal{C}_{Z/X}
$$
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
First find open subspaces $U' \subset X'$ and $U \subset X$ such that
$g(U) \subset U'$ and such that $i(Z) \subset U$ and $i(Z') \subset U'$
are closed (proof existence omitted). Replacing $X$ by $U$ and $X'$ by
$U'$ we may assume that $i$ and $i'$ are closed immersions.
Let $\mathcal{I}' \subset \mathcal{O}_{X'}$ and
$\mathcal{I} \subset \mathcal{O}_X$ be the quasi-coherent sheaves of
ideals associated to $i'$ and $i$, see
Morphisms of Spaces, Lemma \ref{spaces-morphisms-lemma-closed-immersion-ideals}.
Consider the composition
$$
g^{-1}\mathcal{I}' \to g^{-1}\mathcal{O}_{X'}
\xrightarrow{g^\sharp} \mathcal{O}_X \to
\mathcal{O}_X/\mathcal{I} = i_*\mathcal{O}_Z
$$
Since $g(i(Z)) \subset Z'$ we conclude this composition is zero (see
statement on factorizations in
Morphisms of Spaces,
Lemma \ref{spaces-morphisms-lemma-closed-immersion-ideals}).
Thus we obtain a commutative diagram
$$
\xymatrix{
0 \ar[r] &
\mathcal{I} \ar[r] &
\mathcal{O}_X \ar[r] &
i_*\mathcal{O}_Z \ar[r] &
0 \\
0 \ar[r] &
g^{-1}\mathcal{I}' \ar[r] \ar[u] &
g^{-1}\mathcal{O}_{X'} \ar[r] \ar[u] &
g^{-1}i'_*\mathcal{O}_{Z'} \ar[r] \ar[u] &
0
}
$$
The lower row is exact since $g^{-1}$ is an exact functor.
By exactness we also see that
$(g^{-1}\mathcal{I}')^2 = g^{-1}((\mathcal{I}')^2)$.
Hence the diagram induces a map
$g^{-1}(\mathcal{I}'/(\mathcal{I}')^2) \to \mathcal{I}/\mathcal{I}^2$.
Pulling back (using $i^{-1}$ for example) to $Z$ we obtain
$i^{-1}g^{-1}(\mathcal{I}'/(\mathcal{I}')^2) \to \mathcal{C}_{Z/X}$.
Since $i^{-1}g^{-1} = f^{-1}(i')^{-1}$ this gives a map
$f^{-1}\mathcal{C}_{Z'/X'} \to \mathcal{C}_{Z/X}$, which induces
the desired map.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-conormal-functorial-more}
Let $S$ be a scheme. The conormal sheaf of
Definition \ref{definition-conormal-sheaf}, and its functoriality of
Lemma \ref{lemma-conormal-functorial}
satisfy the following properties:
\begin{enumerate}
\item If $Z \to X$ is an immersion of schemes over $S$, then the conormal
sheaf agrees with the one from
Morphisms, Definition \ref{morphisms-definition-conormal-sheaf}.
\item If in
Lemma \ref{lemma-conormal-functorial}
all the spaces are schemes, then the map
$f^*\mathcal{C}_{Z'/X'} \to \mathcal{C}_{Z/X}$ is the same
as the one constructed in
Morphisms, Lemma \ref{morphisms-lemma-conormal-functorial}.
\item Given a commutative diagram
$$
\xymatrix{
Z \ar[r]_i \ar[d]_f & X \ar[d]^g \\
Z' \ar[r]^{i'} \ar[d]_{f'} & X' \ar[d]^{g'} \\
Z'' \ar[r]^{i''} & X''
}
$$
then the map $(f' \circ f)^*\mathcal{C}_{Z''/X''} \to \mathcal{C}_{Z/X}$
is the same as the composition of
$f^*\mathcal{C}_{Z'/X'} \to \mathcal{C}_{Z/X}$
with the pullback by $f$ of
$(f')^*\mathcal{C}_{Z''/X''} \to \mathcal{C}_{Z'/X'}$
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Omitted. Note that Part (1) is a special case of
Lemma \ref{lemma-etale-conormal}.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-conormal-functorial-flat}
Let $S$ be a scheme. Let
$$
\xymatrix{
Z \ar[r]_i \ar[d]_f & X \ar[d]^g \\
Z' \ar[r]^{i'} & X'
}
$$
be a fibre product diagram of algebraic spaces over $S$. Assume
$i$, $i'$ immersions. Then the canonical map
$f^*\mathcal{C}_{Z'/X'} \to \mathcal{C}_{Z/X}$ of
Lemma \ref{lemma-conormal-functorial}
is surjective. If $g$ is flat, then it is an isomorphism.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Choose a commutative diagram
$$
\xymatrix{
U \ar[r] \ar[d] & X \ar[d] \\
U' \ar[r] & X'
}
$$
where $U$, $U'$ are schemes and the horizontal arrows are surjective
and \'etale, see
Spaces, Lemma \ref{spaces-lemma-lift-morphism-presentations}.
Then using
Lemmas \ref{lemma-etale-conormal} and \ref{lemma-conormal-functorial-more}
we see that the question reduces to the case of a morphism of schemes.
In the schemes case this is
Morphisms, Lemma \ref{morphisms-lemma-conormal-functorial-flat}.
\end{proof}





\section{Sheaf of differentials of a morphism}
\label{section-sheaf-differentials}

\noindent
We suggest the reader take a look at the corresponding section
in the chapter on commutative algebra
(Algebra, Section \ref{algebra-section-differentials}),
the corresponding section in the chapter on morphism of schemes
(Morphisms, Section \ref{morphisms-section-sheaf-differentials})
as well as
Modules on Sites, Section \ref{sites-modules-section-differentials}.
We first show that the notion of sheaf of differentials for a
morphism of schemes agrees with the corresponding morphism of
small \'etale (ringed) sites.

\medskip\noindent
To clearly state the following lemma we temporarily go back to
denoting $\mathcal{F}^a$ the sheaf of $\mathcal{O}_{X_{\acute{e}tale}}$-modules
associated to a quasi-coherent $\mathcal{O}_X$-module $\mathcal{F}$
on the scheme $X$, see
Descent, Definition \ref{descent-definition-structure-sheaf}.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-match-modules-differentials}
Let $f : X \to Y$ be a morphism of schemes. Let
$f_{small} : X_{\acute{e}tale} \to Y_{\acute{e}tale}$ be the associated
morphism of small \'etale sites, see
Descent, Remark \ref{descent-remark-change-topologies-ringed-sites}.
Then there is a canonical isomorphism
$$
(\Omega_{X/Y})^a = \Omega_{X_{\acute{e}tale}/Y_{\acute{e}tale}}
$$
compatible with universal derivations. Here the first module
is the sheaf on $X_{\acute{e}tale}$ associated
to the quasi-coherent $\mathcal{O}_X$-module $\Omega_{X/Y}$, see
Morphisms, Definition \ref{morphisms-definition-sheaf-differentials},
and the second module is the one from
Modules on Sites,
Definition \ref{sites-modules-definition-module-differentials}.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Let $h : U \to X$ be an \'etale morphism. In this case the natural map
$h^*\Omega_{X/Y} \to \Omega_{U/Y}$ is an isomorphism. Combine
Morphisms, Lemma \ref{morphisms-lemma-triangle-differentials-smooth}
with the fact that $\Omega_{U/X} = 0$ (an \'etale morphism $U \to X$
is a smooth morphism of schemes such that $\Omega_{U/X} = 0$,
see discussion surrounding
Morphisms, Definition \ref{morphisms-definition-etale}).
This means that there is a natural $\mathcal{O}_{Y_{\acute{e}tale}}$-derivation
$$
\text{d}^a : \mathcal{O}_{X_{\acute{e}tale}} \longrightarrow (\Omega_{X/Y})^a
$$
since we have just seen that the value of $(\Omega_{X/Y})^a$ on any object
$U$ of $X_{\acute{e}tale}$ is canonically identified with
$\Gamma(U, \Omega_{U/Y})$. By the universal property of
$\text{d}_{X/Y} :
\mathcal{O}_{X_{\acute{e}tale}}
\to
\Omega_{X_{\acute{e}tale}/Y_{\acute{e}tale}}$
there is a unique $\mathcal{O}_{X_{\acute{e}tale}}$-linear map
$c : \Omega_{X_{\acute{e}tale}/Y_{\acute{e}tale}} \to (\Omega_{X/Y})^a$
such that
$\text{d}^a = c \circ \text{d}_{X/Y}$.

\medskip\noindent
Conversely, suppose that $\mathcal{F}$ is an
$\mathcal{O}_{X_{\acute{e}tale}}$-module
and $D : \mathcal{O}_{X_{\acute{e}tale}} \to \mathcal{F}$ is a
$\mathcal{O}_{Y_{\acute{e}tale}}$-derivation. Then we can simply restrict
$D$ to the small Zariski site $X_{Zar}$ of $X$. Since sheaves on $X_{Zar}$
agree with sheaves on $X$, see
Descent, Remark \ref{descent-remark-Zarsiki-site-space},
we see that $D|_{X_{Zar}} : \mathcal{O}_X \to \mathcal{F}|_{X_{Zar}}$
is just a ``usual'' $Y$-derivation. Hence we obtain a map
$\psi : \Omega_{X/Y} \longrightarrow \mathcal{F}|_{X_{Zar}}$
such that $D|_{X_{Zar}} = \psi \circ \text{d}$. In particular, if we
apply this with $\mathcal{F} = \Omega_{X_{\acute{e}tale}/Y_{\acute{e}tale}}$
we obtain a map
$$
c' :
\Omega_{X/Y}
\longrightarrow
\Omega_{X_{\acute{e}tale}/Y_{\acute{e}tale}}|_{X_{Zar}}
$$
Denote $\text{id}_{\acute{e}tale, Zar} : X_{\acute{e}tale} \to X_{Zar}$
the morphism of ringed sites discussed in
Descent, Remark \ref{descent-remark-change-topologies-ringed-sites}.
Pulling back $c'$ by this morphism gives
$$
\text{id}_{\acute{e}tale, Zar}^*c' :
(\Omega_{X/Y})^a
\longrightarrow
\text{id}_{\acute{e}tale, Zar}^*\left(
\Omega_{X_{\acute{e}tale}/Y_{\acute{e}tale}}|_{X_{Zar}}\right)
$$
Since the restriction functor $\mathcal{F} \mapsto \mathcal{F}|_{X_{Zar}}$
is equal to $\text{id}_{\acute{e}tale, Zar, *}$ there is an adjunction map
$$
\text{id}_{\acute{e}tale, Zar}^*\left(
\Omega_{X_{\acute{e}tale}/Y_{\acute{e}tale}}|_{X_{Zar}}\right)
\longrightarrow
\Omega_{X_{\acute{e}tale}/Y_{\acute{e}tale}}
$$
and by compostition we obtain a map
$$
c'' :
(\Omega_{X/Y})^a
\longrightarrow
\Omega_{X_{\acute{e}tale}/Y_{\acute{e}tale}}
$$
We claim that $c''$ and $c'$ are mutually inverse (which finishes the lemma).
To see this it is enough to show that $c''(\text{d}(f)) = \text{d}_{X/Y}(f)$
and $c(\text{d}_{X/Y}(f)) = \text{d}(f)$ if $f$ is a local section of
$\mathcal{O}_X$ over an open of $X$. We omit these verifications.
\end{proof}

\noindent
This clears the way for the following definition. For an alternative, see
Remark \ref{remark-alternative}.

\begin{definition}
\label{definition-sheaf-differentials}
Let $S$ be a scheme. Let $f : X \to Y$ be a morphism of algebraic spaces
over $S$. The {\it sheaf of differentials $\Omega_{X/Y}$ of $X$ over $Y$}
is sheaf of differentials
(Modules on Sites,
Definition \ref{sites-modules-definition-sheaf-differentials})
for the morphism of ringed topoi
$$
(f_{small}, f^\sharp) :
(X_{\acute{e}tale}, \mathcal{O}_X)
\to
(Y_{\acute{e}tale}, \mathcal{O}_Y)
$$
of
Properties of Spaces,
Lemma \ref{spaces-properties-lemma-morphism-ringed-topoi}.
The {\it universal $Y$-derivation} will be denoted
$\text{d}_{X/Y} : \mathcal{O}_X \to \Omega_{X/Y}$.
\end{definition}

\noindent
By
Lemma \ref{lemma-match-modules-differentials}
this does not conflict with the already existing
notion in case $X$ and $Y$ are representable. From now on, if $X$ and $Y$
are representable, we no longer distinguish between the sheaf of differentials
defined above and the one defined in
Morphisms, Definition \ref{morphisms-definition-sheaf-differentials}.
We want to relate this to the usual modules of differentials for
morphisms of schemes. Here is the key lemma.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-localize-differentials}
Let $S$ be a scheme. Let $f : X \to Y$ be a morphism of algebraic spaces
over $S$. Consider any commutative diagram
$$
\xymatrix{
U \ar[d]_a \ar[r]_\psi & V \ar[d]^b \\
X \ar[r]^f & Y
}
$$
where the vertical arrows are \'etale morphisms of algebraic spaces. Then
$$
\Omega_{X/Y}|_{U_{\acute{e}tale}} = \Omega_{U/V}
$$
In particular, if $U$, $V$ are schemes, then this is equal to the usual
sheaf of differentials of the morphism of schemes $U \to V$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
By
Properties of Spaces, Lemma \ref{spaces-properties-lemma-etale-morphism-topoi}
and Equation (\ref{spaces-properties-equation-restrict})
we may think of the restriction of a sheaf on $X_{\acute{e}tale}$ to
$U_{\acute{e}tale}$ as the pullback by $a_{small}$. Similarly for $b$. By
Modules on Sites, Lemma \ref{sites-modules-lemma-localize-differentials}
we have
$$
\Omega_{X/Y}|_{U_{\acute{e}tale}} =
\Omega_{\mathcal{O}_{U_{\acute{e}tale}}/
a_{small}^{-1}f_{small}^{-1}\mathcal{O}_{Y_{\acute{e}tale}}}
$$
Since $a_{small}^{-1}f_{small}^{-1}\mathcal{O}_{Y_{\acute{e}tale}}
= \psi_{small}^{-1}b_{small}^{-1}\mathcal{O}_{Y_{\acute{e}tale}}
= \psi_{small}^{-1}\mathcal{O}_{V_{\acute{e}tale}}$ we see that the lemma holds.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-module-differentials-quasi-coherent}
Let $S$ be a scheme. Let $f : X \to Y$ be a morphism of algebraic spaces
over $S$. Then $\Omega_{X/Y}$ is a quasi-coherent $\mathcal{O}_X$-module.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Choose a diagram as in
Lemma \ref{lemma-localize-differentials}
with $a$ and $b$ surjective and $U$ and $V$ schemes.
Then we see that $\Omega_{X/Y}|_U = \Omega_{U/V}$ which is
quasi-coherent by
Morphisms, Definition \ref{morphisms-definition-sheaf-differentials}.
Hence we conclude that $\Omega_{X/Y}$ is quasi-coherent by
Properties of Spaces,
Lemma \ref{spaces-properties-lemma-characterize-quasi-coherent}.
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}
\label{remark-alternative}
Now that we know that $\Omega_{X/Y}$ is quasi-coherent we can attempt
to construct it in another manner. For example we can use the result of
Properties of Spaces,
Section \ref{spaces-properties-section-quasi-coherent-presentation}
to construct the sheaf of differentials by glueing.
For example if $Y$ is a scheme and if $U \to X$ is a surjective \'etale morphism
from a scheme towards $X$, then we see that $\Omega_{U/Y}$ is
a quasi-coherent $\mathcal{O}_U$-module, and since $s, t : R \to U$
are \'etale we get an isomorphism
$$
\alpha : s^*\Omega_{U/Y} \to \Omega_{R/Y} \to t^*\Omega_{U/Y}
$$
by using
Morphisms, Lemma \ref{morphisms-lemma-triangle-differentials-smooth}.
You check that this satisfies the cocycle condition and you're done.
If $Y$ is not a scheme, then you define $\Omega_{U/Y}$ as the cokernel
of the map $(U \to Y)^*\Omega_{Y/S} \to \Omega_{U/S}$, and proceed as
before. This two step process is a little bit ugly. Another possibility
is to glue the sheaves $\Omega_{U/V}$ for any diagram as in
Lemma \ref{lemma-localize-differentials}
but this is not very elegant either. Both approaches will work however, and
will give a slightly more elementary construction of the sheaf of
differentials.
\end{remark}


\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-functoriality-differentials}
Let $S$ be a scheme. Let
$$
\xymatrix{
X' \ar[d] \ar[r]_f & X \ar[d] \\
Y' \ar[r] & Y
}
$$
be a commutative diagram of algebraic spaces. The map
$f^\sharp : \mathcal{O}_X \to f_*\mathcal{O}_{X'}$ composed with the map
$f_*\text{d}_{X'/Y'} : f_*\mathcal{O}_{X'} \to f_*\Omega_{X'/Y'}$ is a
$Y$-derivation. Hence we obtain a canonical map of $\mathcal{O}_X$-modules
$\Omega_{X/Y} \to f_*\Omega_{X'/Y'}$, and by
adjointness of $f_*$ and $f^*$ a
canonical $\mathcal{O}_{X'}$-module homomorphism
$$
c_f : f^*\Omega_{X/Y} \longrightarrow \Omega_{X'/Y'}.
$$
It is uniquely characterized by the property that
$f^*\text{d}_{X/Y}(t)$ mapsto $\text{d}_{X'/Y'}(f^* t)$
for any local section $t$ of $\mathcal{O}_X$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
This is a special case of
Module on Sites, Lemma \ref{sites-modules-lemma-functoriality-differentials}.
\end{proof}






\section{Formally smooth, \'etale, unramified transformations}
\label{section-formally-smooth-etale-unramified}

\noindent
Recall that a ring map $R \to A$ is called
{\it formally smooth}, resp.\ {\it formally \'etale},
resp.\ {\it formally unramified}
(see Algebra, Definition \ref{algebra-definition-formally-smooth},
resp.\ Definition \ref{algebra-definition-formally-etale},
resp.\ Definition \ref{algebra-definition-formally-unramified})
if for every commutative solid diagram
$$
\xymatrix{
A \ar[r] \ar@{-->}[rd] & B/I \\
R \ar[r] \ar[u] & B \ar[u]
}
$$
where $I \subset B$ is an ideal of square zero, there
exists a, resp.\ exists a unique, resp.\ exists at most one dotted
arrow which makes the diagram commute. This motivates
the following analogue for morphisms of algebraic spaces, and more
generally functors.

\begin{definition}
\label{definition-formally-smooth-etale-unramified}
Let $S$ be a scheme.
Let $a : F \to G$ be a transformation of functors
$F, G : (\textit{Sch}/S)_{fppf}^{opp} \to \textit{Sets}$.
Consider commutative solid diagrams of the form
$$
\xymatrix{
F \ar[d]_a & T \ar[d]^i \ar[l] \\
G & T' \ar[l] \ar@{-->}[lu]
}
$$
where $T$ and $T'$ are affine schemes and $i$ is a closed immersion
defined by an ideal of square zero.
\begin{enumerate}
\item We say $a$ is {\it formally smooth} if given any solid
diagram as above there exists a dotted arrow making the diagram
commute\footnote{This is just one possible definition that one can
make here. Another slightly weaker condition would be to require that
the dotted arrow exists fppf locally on $T'$. This weaker notion
has in some sense better formal properties.}.
\item We say $a$ is {\it formally \'etale} if given any solid
diagram as above there exists exactly one dotted arrow making the diagram
commute.
\item We say $a$ is {\it formally unramified} if given any solid
diagram as above there exists at most one dotted arrow making the diagram
commute.
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-formally-etale-is-combination}
Let $S$ be a scheme.
Let $a : F \to G$ be a transformation of functors
$F, G : (\textit{Sch}/S)_{fppf}^{opp} \to \textit{Sets}$.
Then $a$ is formally \'etale if and only if $a$ is both formally
smooth and formally unramified.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Formal from the definition.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-composition-formally-smooth-etale-unramified}
Composition.
\begin{enumerate}
\item A composition of formally smooth transformations of functors is formally
smooth.
\item A composition of formally \'etale transformations of functors is formally
\'etale.
\item A composition of formally unramified transformations of functors is
formally unramified.
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
This is formal.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-base-change-formally-smooth-etale-unramified}
Let $S$ be a scheme contained in $\textit{Sch}_{fppf}$.
Let $F, G, H : (\textit{Sch}/S)_{fppf}^{opp} \to \textit{Sets}$.
Let $a : F \to G$, $b : H \to G$ be transformations of functors.
Consider the fibre product diagram
$$
\xymatrix{
H \times_{b, G, a} F \ar[r]_-{b'} \ar[d]_{a'} & F \ar[d]^a \\
H \ar[r]^b & G
}
$$
\begin{enumerate}
\item If $a$ is formally smooth, then the base change $a'$ is
formally smooth.
\item If $a$ is formally \'etale, then the base change $a'$ is
formally \'etale.
\item If $a$ is formally unramified, then the base change $a'$ is
formally unramified.
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
This is formal.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-representable-property-formally-property}
Let $S$ be a scheme.
Let $F, G : (\textit{Sch}/S)_{fppf}^{opp} \to \textit{Sets}$.
Let $a : F \to G$ be a representable tranformation of functors.
\begin{enumerate}
\item If $a$ is smooth then $a$ is formally smooth.
\item If $a$ is \'etale, then $a$ is formally \'etale.
\item If $a$ is unramified, then $a$ is formally unramified.
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Consider a solid commutative diagram
$$
\xymatrix{
F \ar[d]_a & T \ar[d]^i \ar[l] \\
G & T' \ar[l] \ar@{-->}[lu]
}
$$
as in
Definition \ref{definition-formally-smooth-etale-unramified}.
Then $F \times_G T'$ is a scheme smooth (resp.\ \'etale, resp.\ unramified)
over $T'$. Hence by
More on Morphisms, Lemma \ref{more-morphisms-lemma-smooth-formally-smooth}
(resp.\ Lemma \ref{more-morphisms-lemma-etale-formally-etale}, 
resp.\ Lemma \ref{more-morphisms-lemma-unramified-formally-unramified})
we can fill in (resp.\ uniquely fill in, resp.\ fill in in at most
one way) the dotted arrow in the diagram
$$
\xymatrix{
F \times_G T' \ar[d] & T \ar[d]^i \ar[l] \\
T' & T' \ar[l] \ar@{-->}[lu]
}
$$
an hence we also obtain the corresponding assertion in the first diagram.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-etale-on-top}
Let $S$ be a scheme contained in $\textit{Sch}_{fppf}$.
Let $F, G, H : (\textit{Sch}/S)_{fppf}^{opp} \to \textit{Sets}$.
Let $a : F \to G$, $b : G \to H$ be transformations of functors.
Assume that $a$ is representable, surjective, and \'etale.
\begin{enumerate}
\item If $b$ is formally smooth, then $b \circ a$ is formally smooth.
\item If $b$ is formally \'etale, then $b \circ a$ is formally \'etale.
\item If $b$ is formally unramified, then $b \circ a$ is formally unramified.
\end{enumerate}
Conversely, consider a solid commutative diagram
$$
\xymatrix{
G \ar[d]_b & T \ar[d]^i \ar[l] \\
H & T' \ar[l] \ar@{-->}[lu]
}
$$
with $T'$ an affine scheme over $S$
and $i : T \to T'$ a closed immersion defined by an ideal of square zero.
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(4)] If $b \circ a$ is formally smooth, then for every $t \in T$
there exists an \'etale morphism of affines $U' \to T'$ and a morphism
$U' \to G$ such that
$$
\xymatrix{
G \ar[d]_b & T \ar[l] & T \times_{T'} U' \ar[d] \ar[l]\\
H & T' \ar[l] & U' \ar[llu] \ar[l]
}
$$
commutes and $t$ is in the image of $U' \to T'$.
\item[(5)] If $b \circ a$ is formally unramified, then there exists at most
one dotted arrow in the diagram above, i.e., $b$ is formally unramified.
\item[(6)] If $b \circ a$ is formally \'etale, then there exists exactly one
dotted arrow in the diagram above, i.e., $b$ is formally \'etale.
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Assume $b$ is formally smooth (resp.\ formally \'etale,
resp.\ formally unramified). Since an \'etale morphism is both
smooth and unramified we see that $a$ is representable and smooth
(resp.\ \'etale, resp. unramified). Hence parts (1), (2) and (3)
follow from a combination of
Lemma \ref{lemma-representable-property-formally-property}
and
Lemma \ref{lemma-composition-formally-smooth-etale-unramified}.

\medskip\noindent
Assume that $b \circ a$ is formally smooth. Consider a diagram
as in the statement of the lemma. Let $W = F \times_G T$.
By assumption $W$ is a scheme surjective \'etale over $T$. By
\'Etale Morphisms of Schemes, Theorem \ref{etale-theorem-remarkable-equivalence}
there exists a scheme $W'$ \'etale over $T'$ such that $W = T \times_{T'} W'$.
Choose an affine open subscheme $U' \subset W'$ such that $t$ is in
the image of $U' \to T'$. Because $b \circ a$ is formally
smooth we see that the exist morphisms $U' \to F$ such that
$$
\xymatrix{
F \ar[d]_{b \circ a} & W \ar[l] & T \times_{T'} U' \ar[d] \ar[l]\\
H & T' \ar[l] & U' \ar[llu] \ar[l]
}
$$
commutes. Taking the composition $U' \to F \to G$ gives a
map as in part (5) of the lemma.

\medskip\noindent
Assume that $f, g : T' \to G$ are two dotted arrows fitting into the
diagram of the lemma. Let $W = F \times_G T$.
By assumption $W$ is a scheme surjective \'etale over $T$. By
\'Etale Morphisms of Schemes, Theorem \ref{etale-theorem-remarkable-equivalence}
there exists a scheme $W'$ \'etale over $T'$ such that $W = T \times_{T'} W'$.
Since $a$ is formally \'etale the compositions
$$
W' \to T' \xrightarrow{f} G
\quad\text{and}\quad
W' \to T' \xrightarrow{g} G
$$
lift to morphisms $f', g' : W' \to F$ (lift on affine opens and glue by
uniqueness). Now if $b \circ a : F \to H$ is formally unramified, then
$f' = g'$ and hence $f = g$ as $W' \to T'$ is an \'etale covering. This proves
part (6) of the lemma.

\medskip\noindent
Assume that $b \circ a$ is formally \'etale. Then by part (4) we
can \'etale locally on $T'$ find a dotted arrow fitting into the diagram
and by part (5) this dotted arrow is unique. Hence we may glue the
local solutions to get assertion (6). Some details omitted.
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}
\label{remark-tempting}
It is tempting to think that in the situation of
Lemma \ref{lemma-etale-on-top}
we have
``$b$ formally smooth'' $\Leftrightarrow$ ``$b \circ a$ formally smooth''.
However, this is likely not true in general.
\end{remark}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-formally-permanence}
Let $S$ be a scheme.
Let $F, G, H : (\textit{Sch}/S)_{fppf}^{opp} \to \textit{Sets}$.
Let $a : F \to G$, $b : G \to H$ be transformations of functors.
Assume $b$ is formally unramified.
\begin{enumerate}
\item If $b \circ a$ is formally unramified then $a$ is formally unramified.
\item If $b \circ a$ is formally \'etale then $a$ is formally \'etale.
\item If $b \circ a$ is formally smooth then $a$ is formally smooth.
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Let $T \subset T'$ be a closed immersion of affine schemes defined by an ideal
of square zero. Let $g' : T' \to G$ and $f : T \to F$ be given such that
$g'|_T = a \circ f$. Because $b$ is formally unramified, there is a one
to one correspondence between
$$
\{f' : T' \to F \mid f = f'|_T\text{ and }a \circ f' = g'\}
$$
and
$$
\{f' : T' \to F \mid f = f'|_T\text{ and }b \circ a \circ f' = b \circ g'\}.
$$
From this the lemma follows formally.
\end{proof}








\section{Formally unramified morphisms}
\label{section-formally-unramified}

\noindent
In this section we work out what it means that a morphism of algebraic spaces
is formally unramified.

\begin{definition}
\label{definition-formally-unramified}
Let $S$ be a scheme. A morphism $f : X \to Y$ of algebraic spaces over $S$
is said to be {\it formally unramified} if it is formally unramified as a
transformation of functors as in
Definition \ref{definition-formally-smooth-etale-unramified}.
\end{definition}

\noindent
We will not restate the results proved in the more general setting of
formally unramified transformations of functors in
Section \ref{section-formally-smooth-etale-unramified}.
It turns out we can characterize this property in terms of vanishing of the
module of relative differentials, see
Lemma \ref{lemma-characterize-formally-unramified}.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-formally-unramified}
Let $S$ be a scheme. Let $f : X \to Y$ be a morphism of algebraic spaces over
$S$. The following are equivalent:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $f$ is formally unramified,
\item for every diagram
$$
\xymatrix{
U \ar[d] \ar[r]_\psi & V \ar[d] \\
X \ar[r]^f & Y
}
$$
where $U$ and $V$ are schemes and the vertical arrows are \'etale
the morphism of schemes $\psi$ is formally unramified (as in
More on Morphisms,
Definition \ref{more-morphisms-definition-formally-unramified}), and
\item for one such diagram with surjective vertical arrows the morphism
$\psi$ is formally unramified.
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Assume $f$ is formally unramified. By
Lemma \ref{lemma-representable-property-formally-property}
the morphisms $U \to X$ and $V \to Y$ are formally unramified. Thus by
Lemma \ref{lemma-composition-formally-smooth-etale-unramified}
the composition $U \to Y$ is formally unramified. Then it follows from
Lemma \ref{lemma-formally-permanence}
that $U \to V$ is formally unramified. Thus (1) implies (2). And (2)
implies (3) trivially

\medskip\noindent
Assume given a diagram as in (3). By
Lemma \ref{lemma-representable-property-formally-property}
the morphism $V \to Y$ is formally unramified. Thus by
Lemma \ref{lemma-composition-formally-smooth-etale-unramified}
the composition $U \to Y$ is formally unramified. Then it follows from
Lemma \ref{lemma-etale-on-top}
that $X \to Y$ is formally unramified, i.e., (1) holds.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-characterize-formally-unramified}
Let $S$ be a scheme. Let $f : X \to Y$ be a morphism of algebraic spaces over
$S$. The following are equivalent:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $f$ is formally unramified, and
\item $\Omega_{X/Y} = 0$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
This is a combination of
Lemma \ref{lemma-formally-unramified},
More on Morphisms,
Lemma \ref{more-morphisms-lemma-formally-unramified-differentials},
and
Lemma \ref{lemma-localize-differentials}.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-unramified-formally-unramified}
Let $S$ be a scheme.
Let $f : X \to Y$ be a morphism of algebraic spaces over $S$.
The following are equivalent:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The morphism $f$ is unramified,
\item the morphism $f$ is locally of finite type and $\Omega_{X/Y} = 0$, and
\item the morphism $f$ is locally of finite type and formally unramified.
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Choose a diagram
$$
\xymatrix{
U \ar[d] \ar[r]_\psi & V \ar[d] \\
X \ar[r]^f & Y
}
$$
where $U$ and $V$ are schemes and the vertical arrows are \'etale and
surjective. Then we see
\begin{align*}
f\text{ unramified}
& \Leftrightarrow
\psi\text{ unramified} \\
& \Leftrightarrow
\psi\text{ locally finite type and }\Omega_{U/V} = 0 \\
& \Leftrightarrow
f\text{ locally finite type and }\Omega_{X/Y} = 0 \\
& \Leftrightarrow
f\text{ locally finite type and formally unramified}
\end{align*}
Here we have used 
Morphisms, Lemma \ref{morphisms-lemma-unramified-omega-zero} and
Lemma \ref{lemma-characterize-formally-unramified}.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-universally-injective-unramified}
Let $S$ be a scheme.
Let $f : X \to Y$ be a morphism of algebraic spaces over $S$.
The following are equivalent:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $f$ is unramified and a monomorphism,
\item $f$ is unramified and universally injective,
\item $f$ is locally of finite type and a monomorphism,
\item $f$ is universally injective, locally of finite type, and
formally unramfied.
\end{enumerate}
Moreover, in this case $f$ is also representable, separated, and
locally quasi-finite.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
We have seen in
Lemma \ref{lemma-unramified-formally-unramified}
that being formally unramified and locally of finite type is the same thing
as being unramified.
Hence (4) is equivalent to (2).
A monomorphism is certainly formally unramified hence (3) implies (4).
It is clear that (1) implies (3). Finally, if (2) holds, then
$\Delta : X \to X \times_Y X$ is both an open immersion
(Morphisms of Spaces, Lemma
\ref{spaces-morphisms-lemma-diagonal-unramfied-morphism})
and surjective
(Morphisms of Spaces, Lemma
\ref{spaces-morphisms-lemma-universally-injective})
hence an isomorphism, i.e., $f$ is a monomorphism. In this way we see that
(2) implies (1).
Finally, we see that $f$ is representable, separated, and locally
quasi-finite by
Morphisms of Spaces, Lemmas
\ref{spaces-morphisms-lemma-monomorphism-loc-finite-type-loc-quasi-finite} and
\ref{spaces-morphisms-lemma-locally-quasi-finite-separated-representable}.
\end{proof}








\section{Formally \'etale morphisms}
\label{section-formally-etale}

\noindent
In this section we work out what it means that a morphism of algebraic spaces
is formally \'etale.

\begin{definition}
\label{definition-formally-etale}
Let $S$ be a scheme. A morphism $f : X \to Y$ of algebraic spaces over $S$
is said to be {\it formally \'etale} if it is formally \'etale as a
transformation of functors as in
Definition \ref{definition-formally-smooth-etale-unramified}.
\end{definition}

\noindent
We will not restate the results proved in the more general setting of
formally \'etale transformations of functors in
Section \ref{section-formally-smooth-etale-unramified}.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-formally-etale}
Let $S$ be a scheme. Let $f : X \to Y$ be a morphism of algebraic spaces over
$S$. The following are equivalent:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $f$ is formally \'etale,
\item for every diagram
$$
\xymatrix{
U \ar[d] \ar[r]_\psi & V \ar[d] \\
X \ar[r]^f & Y
}
$$
where $U$ and $V$ are schemes and the vertical arrows are \'etale
the morphism of schemes $\psi$ is formally \'etale (as in
More on Morphisms,
Definition \ref{more-morphisms-definition-formally-etale}), and
\item for one such diagram with surjective vertical arrows the morphism
$\psi$ is formally \'etale.
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Assume $f$ is formally \'etale. By
Lemma \ref{lemma-representable-property-formally-property}
the morphisms $U \to X$ and $V \to Y$ are formally \'etale. Thus by
Lemma \ref{lemma-composition-formally-smooth-etale-unramified}
the composition $U \to Y$ is formally \'etale. Then it follows from
Lemma \ref{lemma-formally-permanence}
that $U \to V$ is formally \'etale. Thus (1) implies (2). And (2)
implies (3) trivially

\medskip\noindent
Assume given a diagram as in (3). By
Lemma \ref{lemma-representable-property-formally-property}
the morphism $V \to Y$ is formally \'etale. Thus by
Lemma \ref{lemma-composition-formally-smooth-etale-unramified}
the composition $U \to Y$ is formally \'etale. Then it follows from
Lemma \ref{lemma-etale-on-top}
that $X \to Y$ is formally \'etale, i.e., (1) holds.
\end{proof}















\section{Formally smooth morphisms}
\label{section-formally-smooth}

\noindent
Michael Artin's position on differential criteria of smoothness (e.g.,
Morphisms, Lemma \ref{morphisms-lemma-smooth-at-point}) is that they are
basically useless (in practice). In this section we introduce the
notion of a formally smooth morphism $X \to Y$. Such a morphism is
characterized by the property that $T$-valued points of $X$ lift
to inifinitesimal thickenings of $T$ provided $T$ is affine.
The main result is that a morphism which is formally smooth and
locally of finite presentation is smooth, see
Lemma \ref{lemma-smooth-formally-smooth}.
It turns out that this criterion is often easier to use than the
differential criteria mentioned above.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-action-by-derivations}
Let $S$ be a scheme. Consider a commutative diagram of morphisms of
algebraic spaces
$$
\xymatrix{
T \ar[r]_a \ar[d]_i & X \ar[d]^f \\
T' \ar[r] & Y
}
$$
over $S$. Assume $i : T \to T'$ be a closed immersion of defined by an
ideal $\mathcal{I} \subset \mathcal{O}_{T'}$ of square zero.
\begin{enumerate}
\item The rule
$$
W' \mapsto
\{a' \in \text{Mor}_Y(W', X) \text{ such that }
a'|_{T \times_{T'} W'} = a|_{T \times_{T'} W'}\}
$$
defines a sheaf of sets $\mathcal{F}$ on $T'_{spaces, \acute{e}tale}$.
\item There is an action of the sheaf
$$
\mathcal{H}
=
i_*\textit{Hom}_{\mathcal{O}_T}(a^*\Omega^1_{X/Y}, i^*\mathcal{I})
$$
on the sheaf $\mathcal{F}$.
\item Moreover, the action
$\mathcal{H}(W') \times \mathcal{F}(W') \to \mathcal{F}(W')$
is simply transitive for any object $W'$ of $T'_{spaces, \acute{e}tale}$
such that $\mathcal{F}(W') \not = \emptyset$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Let $\{W'_j \to W'\}_{j \in J}$ be a covering of $T'_{spaces, \acute{e}tale}$.
Let $a'_j : W'_j \to X$ be elements of $\mathcal{F}(W'_j)$ such that
$a'_j|_{W'_j \times_{W'} W'_{j'}} = a'_{j'}|_{W'_j \times_{W'} W'_{j'}}$.
In this situation
$$
\xymatrix{
\coprod_{j, j'} W'_j \times_{W'} W'_{j'}
\ar@<1ex>[r]  \ar@<-1ex>[r] &
\coprod_j W'_j \ar[r] &
W'
}
$$
is a coequalizer diagram of sheaves on $(\textit{Sch}/S)_{fppf}$.
Hence the morphisms $a'_j$ give rise to a unique morphism $a' : W' \to X$
because $X$ is a sheaf. Then $a' \in \mathcal{F}(W')$ (we omit the
verification). Hence $\mathcal{F}$ is a sheaf.

\medskip\noindent
Since $\mathcal{F}$ and $\mathcal{H}$ are sheaves it is enough to construct
the maps $\mathcal{H}(W') \times \mathcal{F}(W') \to \mathcal{F}(W')$
locally on $T'_{spaces, \acute{e}tale}$. Namely, it is enough to find a set
of objects $\mathcal{S} \subset \text{Ob}(T'_{spaces, \acute{e}tale})$
such that
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(i)] every object of $T'_{spaces, \acute{e}tale}$ has a covering by
objects of $\mathcal{S}$,
\item[(ii)] for every $W' \in \mathcal{S}$ we have an action
$\mathcal{H}(W') \times \mathcal{F}(W') \to \mathcal{F}(W')$, and
\item[(iii)] the actions are compatible with restriction mappings for
morphisms between elements of $\mathcal{S}$.
\end{enumerate}
We omit the proof that this suffices to define the action globally
(this should be added somewhere in the chapter on sites and sheaves).
Let us define the set of objects $\mathcal{S}$ we are going to use.
Choose a commutative diagram
$$
\xymatrix{
X \ar[d]^f & U \ar[l]^\psi \ar[d] \\
Y & V \ar[l]
}
$$
where $U$ and $V$ are schemes and the morphisms $U \to X$ and $V \to Y$
are \'etale. We define $\mathcal{S}$ to be the set of objects $W'$ of
$T'_{spaces, \acute{e}tale}$ which are schemes, and such that the composition
$T \times_{T'} W' \to T \to X$ factors through $U$.

\medskip\noindent
Let us verify points (i), (ii), and (iii). For part (i) we note that
any object $W'$ has an \'etale covering by schemes, hence we may assume $W'$ is
a scheme. The fibre product $(T \times_{T'} W') \times_X U$
is a scheme surjective and \'etale over $T \times_{T'} W'$. By
\'Etale Morphisms of Schemes, Theorem \ref{etale-theorem-remarkable-equivalence}
there exists a surjective \'etale morphism of schemes $W'' \to W'$ such that
$T \times_{T'} W'' \cong T \times_{T'} W'$.
Thus $\{W'' \to W'\}$ is the covering we are looking for.
This proves (i).

\medskip\noindent
To prove (ii) choose $W' \in \mathcal{S}$ and $a' : W' \to X$ an element
of $\mathcal{F}(W')$ and
$$
\theta :
a^*\Omega_{X/Y}|_{T \times_{T'} W'}
\longrightarrow
i^*\mathcal{I}|_{T \times_{T'} W'}
$$
an element of $\mathcal{H}(W')$. Denote $W = T \times_{T'} W'$.
Note that $\mathcal{I}_W = i^*\mathcal{I}|_W$ is just the ideal
defining the closed subscheme $W \subset W'$.
By assumption $W' \in \mathcal{S}$ there exists a morphism
$\tilde a : W \to U$ such that the solid diagram
$$
\xymatrix{
W \ar[r]_{\tilde a} \ar[d] & U \ar[d] \\
W' \ar[r]^{a'} \ar@{..>}[ru] & X
}
$$
is commutative. This implies the dotted arrow $\tilde a' : W' \to U$
exists because $W' \times_X U \to W'$ is \'etale and has a section over the
closed subscheme $W \subset W'$, see
\'Etale Morphisms of Schemes,
Theorem \ref{etale-theorem-remarkable-equivalence}.
Let $\tilde \theta : (\tilde a)^*\Omega_{U/V} \to \mathcal{I}_W$
be the map $\theta$ composed with the isomorphism
$\Omega_{X/Y}|_U \cong \Omega_{U/V}$ pulled back via $\tilde a$.
Finally we can define $\theta \cdot a'$ as
$\psi \circ (\tilde\theta \cdot \tilde a')$ where
$\tilde\theta \cdot \tilde a'$ is as defined in 
More Morphisms, Lemma \ref{more-morphisms-lemma-action-by-derivations}.

\medskip\noindent
Actually, we still have to show that the construction does not
depend on the choice of the morphism $\tilde a' : W' \to U$
(and also the morphism $\tilde a$) chosen above. To see this suppose
we have two choices, say $\tilde a'_1, \tilde a'_2$. In this case
we get a morphism
$$
(\tilde a'_1, \tilde a'_2) :
W'
\longrightarrow
U \times_X U
$$
At this point we can use
More on Morphisms,
Lemma \ref{more-morphisms-lemma-action-by-derivations-etale-localization}
for the two diagrams ($i = 1, 2$)
$$
\xymatrix{
W \ar[r] \ar[d] & W' \ar[rr]_-{(\tilde a_1', \tilde a_2')} \ar[d] & &
U \times_X U \ar[dd] \ar[ld]^{\text{pr}_i} \\
W \ar[r] & W' \ar[r]_{\tilde a_i'} & U \ar[d] & \\
& & V & V \times_Y V \ar[l]_-{\text{pr}_i}
}
$$
to conclude that
$$
(\tilde \theta \cdot \tilde a'_1, \tilde \theta \cdot \tilde a'_2)
=
\theta_{U \times_X U} \cdot (\tilde a'_1, \tilde a'_2)
$$
as morphisms from $W'$ to $U \times_X U$, where $\theta_{U \times_X U}$
is the composition
$$
\xymatrix{
(a_1, a_2)^*\Omega_{U \times_X U/V \times_Y V}
\ar@{=}[r] &
a^*\Omega_{X/Y}|_W \ar[r]^-{\theta} &
\mathcal{I}_W
}
$$
The reason this works is that, allthough a priori there are two
$\theta_{U \times_X U}$ coming from the two diagrams (by the procedure
explained in the lemma cited) these are the same since they
both come from $\theta$, namely, they are the map given above (some details
omitted). Hence we conclude that
$(\tilde \theta \cdot \tilde a'_1, \tilde \theta \cdot \tilde a'_2)$
is a morphism into $U \times_X U$, i.e., the compositions
$\psi \circ (\tilde \theta \cdot \tilde a'_1)$ and
$\psi \circ (\tilde \theta \cdot \tilde a'_2)$ agree. This finishes
the proof of (ii) above.

\medskip\noindent
In a similar manner one shows that (iii) holds (using
More on Morphisms,
Lemma \ref{more-morphisms-lemma-action-by-derivations-etale-localization}
once more). Details omitted.

\medskip\noindent
The proof of (3) is omitted. Hint: Reduce to the schemes case by
argueing similarly to the above.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-smooth-formally-smooth}
(Infinitesimal lifting criterion)
Let $S$ be a scheme.
Let $f : X \to Y$ be a morphism of algebraic spaces over $S$.
The following are equivalent:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The morphism $f$ is smooth.
\item The morphism $f$ is locally of finite presentation, and
formally smooth as a transformation of functors.
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}

\section{The structure of quasi-finite morphisms}
\label{section-structure-quasi-finite}


\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-characterize-closed-immersion}
Let $S$ be a scheme.
Let $f : X \to Y$ be a morphism of algebraic spaces over $S$.
The following are equivalent:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $f$ is a closed immersion,
\item $f$ is universally closed, unramified, and a monomorphism,
\item $f$ is universally closed, unramified, and universally injective,
\item $f$ is universally closed, locally of finite type, and a monomorphism,
\item $f$ is universally closed, universally injective, locally of
finite type, and formally unramfied.
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
The equivalence of (2) -- (5) follows immediately from
Lemma \ref{lemma-universally-injective-unramified}.
Moreover, if (2) -- (5) are satisfied then $f$ is representable.
Similarly, if (1) is satified then $f$ is representable.
Hence the result follows from the case of schemes, see
More on Morphisms,
Lemma \ref{more-morphisms-lemma-characterize-closed-immersion}.
\end{proof}
