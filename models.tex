\section{Introduction}
\label{section-introduction}

\noindent
In this chapter we prove the semistable reduction theorem for curves.
We will use the method of Artin and Winters from their paper
\cite{Artin-Winters}.

\medskip\noindent
It turns out that one can prove the semistable reduction theorem
for curves without any results on desingularization. Namely, there
is a way to esthablish the existence and projectivity of moduli
of semistable curves using Geometric Invariant Theory (GIT)
as developped by Mumford, see \cite{GIT}. This method was
championed by Gieseker who proved the full result in his
lecture notes \cite{Gieseker}. This is quite an amazing
feat: it seems somewhat counter intuitive that one can
prove such a result without ever truly studying families curves over
a positive dimensional base.

\medskip\noindent
Historically the first proof of the semistable reduction theorem
for curves can be found in the paper \cite{DM} by Deligne and Mumford.
It proves the theorem by reducing the problem to the case of
Abelian varieties which was already known at the time thanks
to Grothendieck and others, see \cite{SGA7-I} and \cite{SGA7-II}).
In hindsight the semistable reduction theorem for abelian varieties seems
a lot harder, {\it especially} if one is to prove it without access
to the semistable reduction theorem for curves.

\medskip\noindent
The method in the paper by Artin and Winters consists in analyzing the
possibilities for the special fibre and concluding using an inequality
for torsion in the Picard group of a $1$-dimensional scheme over a field.
A similar argument can be found in a paper \cite{Saito} of Saito who uses
\'etale cohomology directly and who obtains a stronger result in that
he can characterize semistable reduction in terms of the action of
the inertia on $\ell$-adic \'etale cohomology.

\medskip\noindent
A different approach one can use to prove the theorem is to use
rigid analytic geometry techniques. Here we refer the reader to
\cite{vanderPut} and \cite{Arzdorf-Wewers}.

\medskip\noindent
The paper \cite{Temkin} by Temkin uses valuation theoretic techniques
(and proves a lot more besides); also Appendix A of this paper gives
a nice overview of the different proofs and the relationship with
desingularizations of $2$ dimensional schemes.

\medskip\noindent
Another overview paper that the reader may wish to consult is
\cite{Abbes-ssr} written by Ahmed Abbes.
