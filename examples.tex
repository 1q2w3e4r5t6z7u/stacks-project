\section{Non-quasi-affine variety with quasi-affine normalization}
\label{section-nonquasi-affine}

\noindent
Let $k$ be a field of characteristic not equal to $2$.
Let $Y = \mathbf{A}^2_k \setminus \{(0, 0)\}$.
We are going to construct a finite surjective birational morphism
$$
\pi : Y \longrightarrow X
$$
with $X$ a variety over $k$ such that $X$ is not quasi-affine.
Namely, consider the following curves in $Y$:
$$
\begin{matrix}
C_1 & : & x = 0 \\
C_2 & : & y = 0
\end{matrix}
$$
Note that $C_1 \cap C_2 = \emptyset$. We choose the isomorphism
$\varphi : C_1 \to C_2$, $(0, y) \mapsto (y^{-1}, 0)$.
We claim there is a unique morphism $\pi : Y \to X$ as above
such that
$$
\xymatrix{
C_1
\ar@<1ex>[rr]^{embed} \ar@<-1ex>[rr]_{\varphi}
& &
Y \ar[r]^\pi & X
}
$$
is a coequalizer diagram in the category of varieties (and even in
the category of schemes). Accepting this for the moment let us
show that such an $X$ cannot be affine. Namely, it is clear
that we would get
$$
\Gamma(X, \mathcal{O}_X) =
\{ f \in k[x, y] \mid f(0, y) = f(y^{-1}, 0)\} =
k \oplus (xy).
$$
In particular these functions do not separate the points $(1, 0)$
and $(2, 0)$ whose images in $X$ are distinct.

\medskip\noindent
To show that $X$ exists consider the Zariski open
$D(x + cy) \subset Y$ of $Y$. This is the spectrum
of the ring
$k[x, y, 1/(x + y)]$
and the curves $C_1$, $C_2$ are completely contained in
$D(x + y)$. Moreover the morphism
$$
C_1 \coprod C_2
\longrightarrow
D(x + y) \cap Y = \text{Spec}(k[x, y, 1/(x + y)])
$$
is a closed immersion. By
Algebra, Lemma \ref{algebra-lemma-fibre-product-finite-type}
the ring
$$
A =
\{f \in k[x, y, 1/(x + y)] \mid f(0, y) = f(y^{-1}, 0)\}
$$
is of finite type over $k$. On the other hand we have the open
$D(xy) \subset Y$ of $Y$. It is the spectrum of the ring
$$
B = k[x, y, 1/xy].
$$
Note that we have $A_{xy} \cong B_{x + y}$ (since $A$ clearly contains
the elements $xyP(x, y)$ any polynomial $P$ and the element $xy/(x + y)$).
The scheme $X$ is obtained by glueing the affine schemes $\text{Spec}(A)$ to
$\text{Spec}(B)$ and hence is clearly of finite type over
$k$. To see that it is separated one has to show that the
ring map $A \otimes_k B \to B_{x + y}$ is surjective; use that $A$
contains the elements $(x + y^{2n - 1})/(x + y)^n$ and the elements
$(y + x^{2n - 1})/(x + y)^n$. We omit the verification.
