\section{Non-quasi-affine variety with quasi-affine normalization}
\label{section-nonquasi-affine}

\noindent
The existence of an example of this kind is mentioned in
\cite[II Remark 6.6.13]{EGA}. They refer to the fifth volume of
EGA for such an example, but the fifth volume did not appear.

\medskip\noindent
Let $k$ be a field.
Let $Y = \mathbf{A}^2_k \setminus \{(0, 0)\}$.
We are going to construct a finite surjective birational morphism
$\pi : Y \longrightarrow X$
with $X$ a variety over $k$ such that $X$ is not quasi-affine.
Namely, consider the following curves in $Y$:
$$
\begin{matrix}
C_1 & : & x = 0 \\
C_2 & : & y = 0
\end{matrix}
$$
Note that $C_1 \cap C_2 = \emptyset$. We choose the isomorphism
$\varphi : C_1 \to C_2$, $(0, y) \mapsto (y^{-1}, 0)$.
We claim there is a unique morphism $\pi : Y \to X$ as above
such that
$$
\xymatrix{
C_1
\ar@<1ex>[rr]^{\text{id}} \ar@<-1ex>[rr]_{\varphi}
& &
Y \ar[r]^\pi & X
}
$$
is a coequalizer diagram in the category of varieties (and even in
the category of schemes). Accepting this for the moment let us
show that such an $X$ cannot be quasi-affine. Namely, it is clear
that we would get
$$
\Gamma(X, \mathcal{O}_X) =
\{ f \in k[x, y] \mid f(0, y) = f(y^{-1}, 0)\} =
k \oplus (xy) \subset k[x, y].
$$
In particular these functions do not separate the points $(1, 0)$
and $(-1, 0)$ whose images in $X$ (we will see below) are distinct
(if the characteristic of $k$ is not $2$).

\medskip\noindent
To show that $X$ exists consider the Zariski open
$D(x + y) \subset Y$ of $Y$. This is the spectrum
of the ring
$k[x, y, 1/(x + y)]$
and the curves $C_1$, $C_2$ are completely contained in
$D(x + y)$. Moreover the morphism
$$
C_1 \coprod C_2
\longrightarrow
D(x + y) \cap Y = \text{Spec}(k[x, y, 1/(x + y)])
$$
is a closed immersion. It follows from
Algebra, Lemma \ref{algebra-lemma-fibre-product-finite-type}
that the ring
$$
A =
\{f \in k[x, y, 1/(x + y)] \mid f(0, y) = f(y^{-1}, 0)\}
$$
is of finite type over $k$. On the other hand we have the open
$D(xy) \subset Y$ of $Y$ which is disjoint from the curves $C_1$
and $C_2$. It is the spectrum of the ring
$$
B = k[x, y, 1/xy].
$$
Note that we have $A_{xy} \cong B_{x + y}$ (since $A$ clearly contains
the elements $xyP(x, y)$ any polynomial $P$ and the element $xy/(x + y)$).
The scheme $X$ is obtained by glueing the affine schemes
$\text{Spec}(A)$ and $\text{Spec}(B)$ using the isomorphism
$A_{xy} \cong B_{x + y}$ and hence is clearly of finite type over
$k$. To see that it is separated one has to show that the
ring map $A \otimes_k B \to B_{x + y}$ is surjective. To see
this use that $A \otimes_k B$ contains the element
$xy/(x + y) \otimes 1/xy$ which maps to $1/(x + y)$.
The morphism $X \to Y$ is given by the natural maps
$D(x + y) \to \text{Spec}(A)$ and $D(xy) \to \text{Spec}(B)$.
Since these are both finite we deduce that $X \to Y$ is finite
as desired. We omit the verification that $X$ is indeed the
coequalizer of the displayed diagram above, however, see
(insert future reference for push outs in the category of schemes
here). Note that the morphism $\pi : Y \to X$ does
map the points  $(1, 0)$
and $(-1, 0)$ to distinct points in $X$ because the
function $(x + y^3)/(x + y)^2 \in A$ has value
$1/1$, resp.\ $-1/(-1)^2 = -1$ which are always distinct
(unless the characteristic is $2$ -- please find your own points
for characteristic $2$). We summarize this discussion in the
form of a lemma.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-quasi-affine-normalization-not-quasi-affine}
Let $k$ be a field.
There exists a variety $X$ whose normalization is quasi-affine but
which is itself not quasi-affine.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
See discussion above and (insert future reference on normalization here).
\end{proof}



\section{Non flasque quasi-coherent sheaf associated to injective module}
\label{section-nonflasque}

\noindent
For more examples of this type see \cite[Expos\'e II, Appendix I]{SGA6}
where Illusie explains some examples due to Verdier.

\medskip\noindent
Consider the affine scheme $X = \text{Spec}(A)$
where 
$$
A = k[f, g, x, y, \{a_n, b_n\}_{n \geq1}]/
(fy - gx, \{a_nf^n + b_ng^n\}_{n \geq 1})
$$
is the ring from
Properties, Example \ref{properties-example-does-not-work-in-general}.
Set $I = (f, g) \subset A$.
Consider the quasi-compact open $U = D(f) \cup D(g)$ of $X$.
We have seen in loc.\ cit.\ that there is a section
$s \in \mathcal{O}_X(U)$ which does not come from an $A$-module
map $I^n \to A$ for any $n \geq 0$.

\medskip\noindent
Let $\alpha : A \to J$ be the embedding of $A$ into an injective $A$-module.
Let $Q = J/\alpha(A)$ and denote $\beta : J \to Q$ the quotient map.
We claim that the map
$$
\Gamma(X, \widetilde{J})
\longrightarrow
\Gamma(U, \widetilde{J})
$$
is not surjective. Namely, we claim that $\alpha(s)$ is not in the image.
To see this, we argue by contradiction. So assume that $x \in J$ is an
element which restricts to $\alpha(s)$ over $U$. Then $\beta(x) \in Q$
is an element which restricts to $0$ over $U$. Hence we know that
$I^n\beta(x) = 0$ for some $n$, see
Properties,
Lemma \ref{properties-lemma-sections-over-quasi-compact-open-in-affine}.
This implies that we get a morphism
$\varphi : I^n \to A$, $h \mapsto \alpha^{-1}(hx)$. It is easy to see that
this morphism $\varphi$ gives rise to the section $s$ via the map of
Properties,
Lemma \ref{properties-lemma-sections-over-quasi-compact-open-in-affine}
which is a contradiction.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-nonflasque}
There exists an affine scheme $X = \text{Spec}(A)$ and an injective
$A$-module $J$ such that $\widetilde{J}$ is not a flasque sheaf on $X$.
Even the restriction $\Gamma(X, \widetilde{J}) \to \Gamma(U, \widetilde{J})$
with $U$ quasi-compact open need not be surjective.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
See above.
