\section{A Noetherian ring of infinite dimension}
\label{section-Noetherian-infinite-dimension}

\noindent
A Noetherian local ring has finite dimension as we saw in
Algebra, Proprosition \ref{algebra-proposition-dimension}.
But there exist Noetherian rings of infinite dimension.
See \cite[Appendix, Example 1]{Nagata}.

\medskip\noindent
Namely, let $k$ be a field, and consider the ring
$$
R = k[x_1, x_2, x_3, \ldots ].
$$
Let $\mathfrak p_i = (x_{2^{i - 1}}, x_{2^{i - 1} + 1}, \ldots, x_{2^i - 1})$
for $i = 1, 2, \ldots$ which are prime ideals of $R$. Let $S$
be the multiplicative subset
$$
S = \bigcap\nolimits_{i \geq 1} (R \setminus \mathfrak p_i).
$$
Consider the ring $A = S^{-1}R$.
We claim that
\begin{enumerate}
\item The maximal ideals of the ring $A$ are the ideals
$\mathfrak m_i = \mathfrak p_iA$.
\item We have $A_{\mathfrak m_i} = R_{\mathfrak p_i}$ which is
a Noetherian local ring of dimension $2^i$.
\item The ring $A$ is Noetherian.
\end{enumerate}
Hence it is clear that this is the example we are looking for.
Details omitted.



\section{Local rings with nonreduced completion}
\label{section-local-completion-nonreduced}

\noindent
In Algebra, Example \ref{algebra-example-bad-dvr-char-p} we gave an example
of a characteristic $p$ Noetherian local domain $R$ of dimension $1$
whose completion is nonreduced. In this section we present the example
of \cite[Proposition 3.1]{Ferrand-Raynaud} which gives a similar
ring in characteristic zero.

\medskip\noindent
Let $\mathbf{C}\{x\}$ be the ring of convergent power series over
the field $\mathbf{C}$ of complex numbers. The ring of all power series
$\mathbf{C}[[x]]$ is its completion. Let $K = \mathbf{C}\{x\}[1/x] = f.f.(B)$
be the field of convergent Laurent series. The $K$-module
$\Omega_{K/\mathbf{C}}$ of algebraic differentials
of $K$ over $\mathbf{C}$ is an infinite dimensional $K$-vector space
(proof omitted). We may choose $f_n \in x\mathbf{C}\{x\}$,
$n \geq 1$ such that
$
\text{d}x, \text{d}f_1, \text{d}f_2, \ldots
$
are part of a basis of $\Omega_{K/\mathbf{C}}$. Thus we can
find a $\mathbf{C}$-derivation
$$
D : \mathbf{C}\{x\} \longrightarrow \mathbf{C}((x))
$$
such that $D(x) = 0$ and $D(f_i) = x^{-n}$. Let
$$
A = \{f \in \mathbf{C}\{x\} \mid D(f) \in \mathbf{C}[[x]]\}
$$
We claim that
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\mathbf{C}\{x\}$ is integral over $A$,
\item $A$ is a local domain,
\item $\dim(A) = 1$,
\item the maximal ideal of $A$ is generated by $x$ and $xf_1$,
\item $A$ is Noetherian, and
\item the completion of $A$ is equal to the ring of dual numbers
over $\mathbf{C}[[x]]$.
\end{enumerate}
Since the dual numbers are nonreduced the ring $A$ gives the example.

\medskip\noindent
Note that if $0 \not = f \in x\mathbf{C}\{x\}$ then
we may write $D(f) = h/f^n$ for some $n \geq 0$ and $h \in \mathbf{C}[[x]]$.
Hence $D(f^{n + 1}/(n + 1)) \in \mathbf{C}[[x]]$
and $D(f^{n + 2}/(n + 2)) \in \mathbf{C}[[x]]$. Thus we
see $f^{n + 1}, f^{n + 2} \in A$!
In particular we see (1) holds. We also conclude that
the fraction field of $A$ is equal to the fraction field of
$\mathbf{C}\{x\}$. It also follows immediately that
$A \cap x\mathbf{C}\{x\}$ is the set of nonunits of $A$, hence
$A$ is a local domain of dimension $1$. If we can show (4)
then it will follow that $A$ is Noetherian (proof omitted).
Suppose that $f \in A \cap x\mathbf{C}\{x\}$. Write
$D(f) = h$, $h \in \mathbf{C}[[x]]$. Write $h = c + xh'$
with $c \in \mathbf{C}$, $h' \in \mathbf{C}[[x]]$. Then
$D(f - cxf_1) = c + xh' - c = xh'$. On the other hand
$f - cxf_1 = xg$ with $g \in \mathbf{C}\{x\}$, but by the
computation above we have $D(g) = h' \in \mathbf{C}[[x]]$
and hence $g \in A$. Thus $f = cxf_1 + xg \in (x, xf_1)$ as desired.

\medskip\noindent
Finally, why is the completion of $A$ nonreduced? Denote $\hat A$ the
completion of $A$. Of course this maps surjectively to the completion
$\mathbf{C}[[x]]$ of $\mathbf{C}\{x\}$ because $x \in A$. Denote
this map $\psi : \hat A \to \mathbf{C}[[x]]$.
Above we saw that $\mathfrak m_A = (x, xf_1)$
and hence $D(\mathfrak m_A^n) \subset (x^{n - 1})$ by an easy
computation. Thus $D : A \to \mathbf{C}[[x]]$ is continuous and
gives rise to a continuous derivation $\hat D : \hat A \to \mathbf{C}[[x]]$
over $\psi$. Hence we get a ring map
$$
\psi + \epsilon \hat D :
\hat A
\longrightarrow
\mathbf{C}[[x]][\epsilon].
$$
Since $\hat A$ is a one dimensional Noetherian complete local ring, if we
can show this arrow is surjective then it will follow that $\hat A$
is nonreduced. Actually the map is an isomorphism but we omit the
verification of this. The subring $\mathbf{C}[x]_{(x)} \subset A$
gives rise to a map $i : \mathbf{C}[[x]] \to \hat A$ on completions such
that $i \circ \psi = \text{id}$ and such that $D \circ i = 0$
(as $D(x) = 0$ by construction). Consider the elements $x^nf_n \in A$.
We have
$$
(\psi + \epsilon D)(x^nf_n) = x^n f_n + \epsilon
$$
for all $n \geq 1$. Surjectivity easily follows from these remarks.


\section{A non catenary Noetherian local ring}
\label{section-non-catenary-Noetherian-local}

\noindent
Even though there is a succesful dimension theory of Noetherian local rings
there are non-catenary Noetherian local rings. An example may be found in
\cite[Appendix, Example 2]{Nagata}. In fact, we will present this example
in the simplest case. Namely, we will construct a local Noetherian domain $A$
of dimension $2$ which is not universally catenary. (Note that $A$ is
automatically catenary, see
Exercise \ref{exercises-exercise-Noetherian-local-domain-dim-2-catenary}.)
The existence of a Noetherian local ring which is not universally
catenary implies the existence of a Noetherian local ring which
is not catenary -- and we spell this out at the end of this section
in the particular example at hand.

\medskip\noindent
Let $k$ be a field, and consider the formal power series ring
$k[[x]]$ in one variable over $k$. Let
$$
z = \sum\nolimits_{i = 1}^\infty a_i x^i
$$
be a formal power series. We assume $z$ as an element of the Laurent
series field $k((x)) = f.f.(k[[x]])$ is transcendental over $k(x)$.
Put
$$
z_j
=
x^{-j}(z - \sum\nolimits_{i = 1, \ldots, j - 1} a_i x^i)
=
\sum\nolimits_{i = j}^\infty a_i x^{i - j}
\in k[[x]].
$$
Note that $Z = z_1$.
Let $R$ be the subring of $k[[x]]$ generated by $x$, $z$ and all of the
$z_j$, in other words
$$
R = k[x, z_1, z_2, z_3, \ldots ] \subset k[[x]].
$$
Consider the ideals $\mathfrak m = (x)$ and
$\mathfrak n = (x - 1, z_1, z_2, \ldots)$ of $R$.

\medskip\noindent
We have $x(z_{j + 1} + a_j) = z_j$. Hence $R/\mathfrak m = k$
and $\mathfrak m$ is a maximal ideal. Moreover, any element of $R$
not in $\mathfrak m$ maps to a unit in $k[[x]]$ and hence
$R_{\mathfrak m} \subset k[[x]]$. In fact it is easy to deduce
that $R_{\mathfrak m}$ is a discrete valuation ring and residue
field $k$.

\medskip\noindent
We claim that
$$
R/(x - 1) =
k[x, z_1, z_2, z_3, \ldots ]/(x - 1)
\cong
k[z].
$$
Namely, the relation above implies that
$(x - 1)(z_{j + 1} + a_j) = -z_{j + 1} - a_j + z_j$, and hence
we may express the class of $z_{j + 1}$ in terms of $z_j$ in
the quotient $R/(x - 1)$. Since the fraction field of $R$
has transcendence degree $2$ over $k$ by construction we see that $z$ is
transcendental over $k$ in $R/(x - 1)$, whence the desired isomorphism.
Hence $\mathfrak n = (x - 1, z)$ and is a maximal ideal. In fact the
map
$$
k[x, x^{-1}, z]_{(x - 1, z)} \longrightarrow R_{\mathfrak n}
$$
is an isomorphism (since $x^{-1}$ is invertible in $R_{\mathfrak n}$
and since $z_{j + 1} = x^{-1}z_j - a_j = \ldots = f_j(x, x^{-1}, z)$).
This shows that $R_{\mathfrak n}$ is a regular local ring
of dimension $2$ and residue field $k$.

\medskip\noindent
Let $S$ be the multiplicative subset
$$
S =
(R \setminus \mathfrak m) \cap (R \setminus \mathfrak n) =
R \setminus (\mathfrak m \cup \mathfrak n)
$$
and set $B = S^{-1}R$. We claim that
\begin{enumerate}
\item The ring $B$ is a $k$-algebra.
\item The maximal ideals of the ring $B$ are the two ideals
$\mathfrak mB$ and $\mathfrak nB$.
\item The residue fields at these maximal ideals is $k$.
\item We have $B_{\mathfrak mB} = R_{\mathfrak m}$
and $B_{\mathfrak nB} = R_{\mathfrak n}$
which are Noetherian regular local rings of dimensions $1$ and $2$.
\item The ring $B$ is Noetherian.
\end{enumerate}
We omit the details of the verifications.

\medskip\noindent
Whenever given a $k$-algebra $B$ with the properties listed above we
get an example as follows. Take $A = k + \text{rad}(B) \subset B$,
in our case $\text{rad}(B) = \mathfrak mB + \mathfrak nB$.
It is easy to see that $B$ is finite over $A$ and hence $A$ is
Noetherian by Eakin's theorem (see \cite{Eakin}, or
\cite[Appendix A1]{Nagata}, or insert future reference here).
Also $A$ is a local domain with the same fraction field as $B$ and
residue field $k$. Since the dimension of $B$ is $2$ we see that $A$
has dimension $2$ as well, by
Algebra, Lemma \ref{algebra-lemma-integral-sub-dim-equal}.

\medskip\noindent
If $A$ were universally catenary then the dimension formula,
Algebra, Lemma \ref{algebra-lemma-dimension-formula}
would give $\dim(B_{\mathfrak mB}) = 2$ contradiction.

\medskip\noindent
Note that $B$ is generated by one element over $A$.
Hence $B = A[x]/\mathfrak p$ for some prime
$\mathfrak p$ of $A[x]$. Let $\mathfrak m' \subset A[x]$ be
the maximal ideal corresponding to $\mathfrak mB$. Then on
the one hand $\dim(A[x]_{\mathfrak m'}) = 3$ and on the
other hand
$$
(0)
\subset \mathfrak pA[x]_{\mathfrak m'}
\subset \mathfrak m'A[x]_{\mathfrak m'}
$$
is a maximal chain of primes. Hence $A[x]_{\mathfrak m'}$ is
an example of a non catenary Noetherian local ring.




\section{Non-quasi-affine variety with quasi-affine normalization}
\label{section-nonquasi-affine}

\noindent
The existence of an example of this kind is mentioned in
\cite[II Remark 6.6.13]{EGA}. They refer to the fifth volume of
EGA for such an example, but the fifth volume did not appear.

\medskip\noindent
Let $k$ be a field.
Let $Y = \mathbf{A}^2_k \setminus \{(0, 0)\}$.
We are going to construct a finite surjective birational morphism
$\pi : Y \longrightarrow X$
with $X$ a variety over $k$ such that $X$ is not quasi-affine.
Namely, consider the following curves in $Y$:
$$
\begin{matrix}
C_1 & : & x = 0 \\
C_2 & : & y = 0
\end{matrix}
$$
Note that $C_1 \cap C_2 = \emptyset$. We choose the isomorphism
$\varphi : C_1 \to C_2$, $(0, y) \mapsto (y^{-1}, 0)$.
We claim there is a unique morphism $\pi : Y \to X$ as above
such that
$$
\xymatrix{
C_1
\ar@<1ex>[rr]^{\text{id}} \ar@<-1ex>[rr]_{\varphi}
& &
Y \ar[r]^\pi & X
}
$$
is a coequalizer diagram in the category of varieties (and even in
the category of schemes). Accepting this for the moment let us
show that such an $X$ cannot be quasi-affine. Namely, it is clear
that we would get
$$
\Gamma(X, \mathcal{O}_X) =
\{ f \in k[x, y] \mid f(0, y) = f(y^{-1}, 0)\} =
k \oplus (xy) \subset k[x, y].
$$
In particular these functions do not separate the points $(1, 0)$
and $(-1, 0)$ whose images in $X$ (we will see below) are distinct
(if the characteristic of $k$ is not $2$).

\medskip\noindent
To show that $X$ exists consider the Zariski open
$D(x + y) \subset Y$ of $Y$. This is the spectrum
of the ring
$k[x, y, 1/(x + y)]$
and the curves $C_1$, $C_2$ are completely contained in
$D(x + y)$. Moreover the morphism
$$
C_1 \coprod C_2
\longrightarrow
D(x + y) \cap Y = \text{Spec}(k[x, y, 1/(x + y)])
$$
is a closed immersion. It follows from
Algebra, Lemma \ref{algebra-lemma-fibre-product-finite-type}
that the ring
$$
A =
\{f \in k[x, y, 1/(x + y)] \mid f(0, y) = f(y^{-1}, 0)\}
$$
is of finite type over $k$. On the other hand we have the open
$D(xy) \subset Y$ of $Y$ which is disjoint from the curves $C_1$
and $C_2$. It is the spectrum of the ring
$$
B = k[x, y, 1/xy].
$$
Note that we have $A_{xy} \cong B_{x + y}$ (since $A$ clearly contains
the elements $xyP(x, y)$ any polynomial $P$ and the element $xy/(x + y)$).
The scheme $X$ is obtained by glueing the affine schemes
$\text{Spec}(A)$ and $\text{Spec}(B)$ using the isomorphism
$A_{xy} \cong B_{x + y}$ and hence is clearly of finite type over
$k$. To see that it is separated one has to show that the
ring map $A \otimes_k B \to B_{x + y}$ is surjective. To see
this use that $A \otimes_k B$ contains the element
$xy/(x + y) \otimes 1/xy$ which maps to $1/(x + y)$.
The morphism $X \to Y$ is given by the natural maps
$D(x + y) \to \text{Spec}(A)$ and $D(xy) \to \text{Spec}(B)$.
Since these are both finite we deduce that $X \to Y$ is finite
as desired. We omit the verification that $X$ is indeed the
coequalizer of the displayed diagram above, however, see
(insert future reference for push outs in the category of schemes
here). Note that the morphism $\pi : Y \to X$ does
map the points  $(1, 0)$
and $(-1, 0)$ to distinct points in $X$ because the
function $(x + y^3)/(x + y)^2 \in A$ has value
$1/1$, resp.\ $-1/(-1)^2 = -1$ which are always distinct
(unless the characteristic is $2$ -- please find your own points
for characteristic $2$). We summarize this discussion in the
form of a lemma.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-quasi-affine-normalization-not-quasi-affine}
Let $k$ be a field.
There exists a variety $X$ whose normalization is quasi-affine but
which is itself not quasi-affine.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
See discussion above and (insert future reference on normalization here).
\end{proof}



\section{Non flasque quasi-coherent sheaf associated to injective module}
\label{section-nonflasque}

\noindent
For more examples of this type see \cite[Expos\'e II, Appendix I]{SGA6}
where Illusie explains some examples due to Verdier.

\medskip\noindent
Consider the affine scheme $X = \text{Spec}(A)$
where
$$
A = k[f, g, x, y, \{a_n, b_n\}_{n \geq1}]/
(fy - gx, \{a_nf^n + b_ng^n\}_{n \geq 1})
$$
is the ring from
Properties, Example \ref{properties-example-does-not-work-in-general}.
Set $I = (f, g) \subset A$.
Consider the quasi-compact open $U = D(f) \cup D(g)$ of $X$.
We have seen in loc.\ cit.\ that there is a section
$s \in \mathcal{O}_X(U)$ which does not come from an $A$-module
map $I^n \to A$ for any $n \geq 0$.

\medskip\noindent
Let $\alpha : A \to J$ be the embedding of $A$ into an injective $A$-module.
Let $Q = J/\alpha(A)$ and denote $\beta : J \to Q$ the quotient map.
We claim that the map
$$
\Gamma(X, \widetilde{J})
\longrightarrow
\Gamma(U, \widetilde{J})
$$
is not surjective. Namely, we claim that $\alpha(s)$ is not in the image.
To see this, we argue by contradiction. So assume that $x \in J$ is an
element which restricts to $\alpha(s)$ over $U$. Then $\beta(x) \in Q$
is an element which restricts to $0$ over $U$. Hence we know that
$I^n\beta(x) = 0$ for some $n$, see
Properties,
Lemma \ref{properties-lemma-sections-over-quasi-compact-open-in-affine}.
This implies that we get a morphism
$\varphi : I^n \to A$, $h \mapsto \alpha^{-1}(hx)$. It is easy to see that
this morphism $\varphi$ gives rise to the section $s$ via the map of
Properties,
Lemma \ref{properties-lemma-sections-over-quasi-compact-open-in-affine}
which is a contradiction.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-nonflasque}
There exists an affine scheme $X = \text{Spec}(A)$ and an injective
$A$-module $J$ such that $\widetilde{J}$ is not a flasque sheaf on $X$.
Even the restriction $\Gamma(X, \widetilde{J}) \to \Gamma(U, \widetilde{J})$
with $U$ quasi-compact open need not be surjective.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
See above.
\end{proof}
