\section{Introduction}
\label{section-introduction}

\noindent
In this chapter we start with a discussion of the de Rham complex
of a ring map and we end with a proof that de Rham cohomology
defines a Weil cohomology theory when the base field has characteristic zero.




\section{The de Rham complex}
\label{section-de-rham-complex}

\noindent
Let $A \to B$ be a ring map. Denote $\text{d} : B \to \Omega_{B/A}$
the module of differentials with its universal $A$-derivation
constructed in Algebra, Section \ref{algebra-section-differentials}.
Let $\Omega_{B/A}^i = \wedge^i_B(\Omega_{B/A})$ for $i \geq 0$ be the
$i$th exterior popwer as in
Algebra, Section \ref{algebra-section-tensor-algebra}.
The {\it de Rham complex of $B$ over $A$} is the complex
$$
\Omega_{B/A}^0 \to \Omega_{B/A}^1 \to \Omega_{B/A}^2 \to \ldots
$$
constructed below.

\medskip\noindent
Given just a ring $R$ we set $\Omega_R = \Omega_{R/\mathbf{Z}}$.
This is sometimes called the absolute module of differentials of $R$;
this makes sense: if $\Omega_R$ is the module of differentials
where we only assume the Leibniz rule and not the vanishing of $\text{d}1$,
then the Leibniz rule gives $\text{d}1 = \text{d}(1 \cdot 1) =
1 \text{d}1 + 1 \text{d}1 = 2 \text{d}1$ and hence
$\text{d}1 = 0$ in $\Omega_R$. In this case the
{\it absolute de Rham complex of $R$} is the corresponding complex
$$
\Omega_R^0 \to \Omega_R^1 \to \Omega_R^2 \to \ldots
$$
where we set $\Omega^i_R = \Omega^i_{R/\mathbf{Z}}$ and so on.

\medskip\noindent
We define the maps $\text{d} : \Omega_{B/A}^p \to \Omega_{B/A}^{p + 1}$
by the rule
$$
\text{d}\left(b_0\text{d}b_1 \wedge \ldots \wedge \text{d}b_p\right) =
\text{d}b_0 \wedge \text{d}b_1 \wedge \ldots \wedge \text{d}b_p
$$
which we will show is well defined; note that
$\text{d} \circ \text{d} = 0$ so we get a complex.
Recall that $\Omega_{B/A}$ is the $B$-module generated by
elements $\text{d}b$ subject to the relations
$\text{d}a = 0$ for $a \in A$ and
$\text{d}(b + b') = \text{d}b + \text{d}b'$ and
$\text{d}(bb') = b\text{d}b' + b'\text{d}b$
for $b, b' \in B$. To prove that our map is well defined for $p = 1$
we have to show that the elements
$$
\text{d}a,
\quad\text{and}\quad
b\text{d}(b' + b'') - b\text{d}b' - b\text{d}b''
\quad\text{and}\quad
b\text{d}(b'b'') - bb'\text{d}b'' - bb''\text{d}b'
$$
for $a \in A$ and  $b, b', b'' \in B$ are mapped to zero by our rule.
This is clear by direct computation (using the Leibniz rule).
Thus we get a map
$$
\Omega^1_{B/A} \otimes_A \ldots \otimes_A \Omega^1_{B/A}
\longrightarrow
\Omega_{B/A}^{p + 1}
$$
defined by the formula
$$
\omega_1 \otimes \ldots \otimes \omega_p
\longmapsto
\sum (-1)^{i + 1}
\omega_1 \wedge \ldots \wedge \text{d}(\omega_i) \wedge \ldots \wedge \omega_p
$$
which matches our rule above on elements of the form
$b_0\text{d}b_1 \otimes \text{d}b_2 \otimes \ldots \otimes \text{d}b_p$.
It is clear that this map is alternating. To finish we have to show
that
$$
\omega_1 \otimes \ldots \otimes f\omega_i \otimes \ldots \otimes \omega_p
\quad\text{and}\quad
\omega_1 \otimes \ldots \otimes f\omega_j \otimes \ldots \otimes \omega_p
$$
are mapped to the same element for $f \in B$ and
$\omega_i$ in $\Omega^1_{B/A}$. By $A$-linearity and
the alternating property, it is enough to show this for $p = 2$, $i = 1$,
$j = 2$, $\omega_1 = b \text{d}b'$ and $\omega_2 = c \text{d} c'$
for $b, b', c, c' \in B$.
Thus we need to show that
\begin{align*}
& \text{d}(fb) \wedge \text{d}b' \wedge c \text{d}c'
- fb \text{d}b' \wedge \text{d}c \wedge \text{d}c' \\
& =
\text{d}b \wedge \text{d}b' \wedge fc\text{d}c'
- b \text{d}b' \wedge \text{d}(fc) \wedge \text{d}c'
\end{align*}
in other words that
$$
(c \text{d}(fb) + fb \text{d}c - fc \text{d}b - b \text{d}(fc))
\wedge \text{d}b' \wedge \text{d}c' = 0.
$$
This follows from the Leibniz rule.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-de-rham-complex}
Let $A \to B$ be a ring map. Let $\pi : \Omega_{B/A} \to \Omega$
be a surjective $B$-module map. Denote $\text{d} : B \to \Omega$
the composition of $\pi$ with the universal derivation
$\text{d}_{B/A} : B \to \Omega_{B/A}$. Set $\Omega^i = \wedge_B^i(\Omega)$.
Assume that the kernel of $\pi$ is generated, as a $B$-module,
by elements $\omega \in \Omega_{B/A}$ such that
$\text{d}_{B/A}(\omega) \in \Omega_{B/A}^2$ maps to zero in $\Omega^2$.
Then there is a de Rham complex
$$
\Omega^0 \to \Omega^1 \to \Omega^2 \to \ldots
$$
whose differential is defined by the rule
$$
\text{d} : \Omega^p \to \Omega^{p + 1},\quad
\text{d}\left(f_0\text{d}f_1 \wedge \ldots \wedge \text{d}f_p\right) =
\text{d}f_0 \wedge \text{d}f_1 \wedge \ldots \wedge \text{d}f_p
$$
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
We will show that there exists a commutative diagram
$$
\xymatrix{
\Omega_{B/A}^0 \ar[d] \ar[r]_{\text{d}_{B/A}} &
\Omega_{B/A}^1 \ar[d]_\pi \ar[r]_{\text{d}_{B/A}} &
\Omega_{B/A}^2 \ar[d]_{\wedge^2\pi} \ar[r]_{\text{d}_{B/A}} &
\ldots \\
\Omega^0 \ar[r]^{\text{d}} &
\Omega^1 \ar[r]^{\text{d}} &
\Omega^2 \ar[r]^{\text{d}} &
\ldots
}
$$
the description of the map $\text{d}$ will follow from the construction
of the differentials
$\text{d}_{B/A} : \Omega^p_{B/A} \to \Omega^{p + 1}_{B/A}$ of the
de Rham complex of $B$ over $A$ given above.
Since the left most vertical arrow is an isomorphism we have
the first square. Because $\pi$ is surjective, to get the second
square it suffices to show that $\text{d}_{B/A}$ maps the kernel
of $\pi$ into the kernel of $\wedge^2\pi$. We are given that any element
of the kernel of $\pi$ is of the form
$\sum b_i\omega_i$ with $\pi(\omega_i) = 0$ and
$\wedge^2\pi(\text{d}_{B/A}(\omega_i)) = 0$.
By the Leibniz rule for $\text{d}_{B/A}$ we have
$\text{d}_{B/A}(\sum b_i\omega_i) = \sum b_i \text{d}_{B/A}(\omega_i) +
\sum \text{d}_{B/A}(b_i) \wedge \omega_i$. Hence this maps to zero
under $\wedge^2\pi$.

\medskip\noindent
For $i > 1$ we note that $\wedge^i \pi$ is surjective with
kernel the image of $\Ker(\pi) \wedge \Omega^{i - 1}_{B/A}
\to \Omega_{B/A}^i$. For $\omega_1 \in \Ker(\pi)$ and
$\omega_2 \in \Omega^{i - 1}_{B/A}$ we have
$$
\text{d}_{B/A}(\omega_1 \wedge \omega_2) =
\text{d}_{B/A}(\omega_1) \wedge \omega_2 -
\omega_1 \wedge \text{d}_{B/A}(\omega_2)
$$
which is in the kernel of $\wedge^{i + 1}\pi$ by what we just proved above.
Hence we get the $(i + 1)$st square in the diagram above.
This concludes the proof.
\end{proof}





\section{Trace maps on de Rham complexes}
\label{section-trace}

\noindent
A reference for some of the material in this section is \cite{Garel}.

\begin{example}
\label{example-no-trace}
Even in mild situations one doesn't have a trace map on de Rham complexes.
For example, consider the $\mathbf{C}$-algebra $B = \mathbf{C}[x, y]$ with
action of $G = \{\pm 1\}$ given by $x \mapsto -x$ and $y \mapsto -y$.
The invariants $A = B^G$ form a normal domain of finite type over $\mathbf{C}$
generated by $x^2, xy, y^2$. We claim that for the inclusion $A \subset B$
there is no reasonable trace map
$\Omega_{B/\mathbf{C}} \to \Omega_{A/\mathbf{C}}$
on $1$-forms. Namely, consider the element
$\omega = x \text{d} y \in \Omega_{B/\mathbf{C}}$.
Since $\omega$ is invariant under the action of $G$ if a ``reasonable''
trace map exists, then $2\omega$ should be in the image of
$\Omega_{A/\mathbf{C}} \to \Omega_{B/\mathbf{C}}$. This is
not the case: there is no way to write $2\omega$ as a linear
combination of $\text{d}(x^2)$, $\text{d}(xy)$, and $\text{d}(y^2)$
even with coefficients in $B$.
This example contradicts the main theorem in
\cite{Zannier}.
\end{example}
