<div class="page_header">
The Stacks Project
</div>



<div class="title">
The tag system
</div>

<div class="index_include">
Each tag refers to a unique lemma, theorem, etc. in order for this project to <br>
be referenceable. These tags don't change even if the lemma (or theorem, etc.) <br>
moves within the text.
</div>



<div class="title">How to use it</div>

<div class="index_include">
To look up a lemma, theorem etc. using a tag, just go to the search <a href="query.php">page</a> and <br>
input the tag in the box.

<div class="space"></div>

To reference a result in the stacks project find its corresponding tag by <br>
hovering/clicking on the lemma, theorem, etc. in the online pdf file. See below <br>
for latex instructions.
</div>



<div class="title">More information</div>

<div class="index_include">
The tag system provides stable references to definitions, lemmas, propositions, <br>
theorems, remarks, examples, exercises, situations and even equations, sections <br>
and items. As the project grows, each of these gets a tag which will always <br>
point to the same mathematical result. The place of the lemma in the document <br>
may change, the lemma may be moved to a different chapter, but its tag always <br>
keeps pointing to it.

<div class="space"></div>

If it ever turns out that a lemma, theorem, etc. was wrong then we may remove <br>
it from the project. However, we will keep the tag, and there will be an <br>
explanation for its disappearance (in the file tags mentioned below).
</div>



<div class="title">How to reference tags in latex documents</div>

<div class="index_include">
In your bibtex file put <br>

<div class="space"></div>

<code>
@MISC{stacks-project, <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AUTHOR	= "The Stacks Project Authors", <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TITLE	= "{\it Stacks Project}", <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HOWPUBLISHED = "\url{http://math.columbia.edu/algebraic_geometry/stacks-git}" <br>
}</code><br>

<div class="space"></div>

Then can use a construction such as

<div class="space"></div>

<code>
\cite[Definition 0123]{stacks-project}
</code>

<div class="space"></div>

to reference the tag. If you feel couragous you can go ahead and make 0123 a <br>
link to the stable url by the following construction

<div class="space"></div>

<code>
\href{http://math.columbia.edu/algebraic_geometry/stacks-git/locate.php?tag=0123}{0123}
</code>
</div>

<div class="title">Technical information</div>

<div class="index_include">
There is a file called <a href="tags/tags">tags</a> (in the tags subdirectory) which has on each line <br>
the tag followed by an identifier. Example: <br>

<div class="space"></div>

<code>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;01MB,constructions-lemma-proj-scheme
</code><br>

<div class="space"></div>

Here the tag is 01MB and the identifier is constructions-lemma-proj-scheme. <br>
This means that the tag points to a lemma from the file constructions.tex. <br>
It currently has the label lemma-proj-scheme. If we ever change the lemma's <br>
label, or move the lemma to a different file, then we will change the <br>
corresponding line in the file tags by changing the identifier correspondingly. <br>
But we will never change the tag. <br>

<div class="space"></div>

New tags are assigned by the maintainer of the project every once in a while <br>
using a script. A tag is a four character string made up out of digits and <br>
capital letters. They are ordered lexicographically between 0000 and ZZZZ <br>
giving 1679616 possible tags. That should be enough for a while!
