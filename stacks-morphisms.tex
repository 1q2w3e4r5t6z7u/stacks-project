\section{Introduction}
\label{section-introduction}

\noindent
In this chapter we introduce some types of morphisms of algebraic stacks.
A reference in the case of quasi-separated algebraic stacks with representable
diagonal is \cite{LM-B}.

\medskip\noindent
The goal is to extend the definition of each of the types of morphisms of
algebraic spaces to morphisms of algebraic stacks. Each case is slightly
different and it seems best to treat them all separately.

\medskip\noindent
For morphisms of algebraic stacks which are representable
by algebraic spaces we have already defined a large number of types of
morphisms, see
Properties of Stacks,
Section \ref{stacks-properties-section-properties-morphisms}.
For each corresponding case in this chapter
we have to make sure the definition in the general
case is compatible with the definition given there.




\section{Conventions and abuse of language}
\label{section-conventions}

\noindent
We continue to use the conventions and the abuse of language
introduced in
Properties of Stacks, Section \ref{stacks-properties-section-conventions}.




\section{Properties of diagonals}
\label{section-diagonals}

\noindent
The diagonal of an algebraic stack is closely related to the
$\mathit{Isom}$-sheaves, see
Algebraic Stacks, Lemma \ref{algebraic-lemma-representable-diagonal}.
By the second defining property of an algebraic stack these
$\mathit{Isom}$-sheaves are always algebraic spaces.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-isom-locally-finite-type}
Let $\mathcal{X}$ be an algebraic stack.
Let $T$ be a scheme and let $x, y$ be objects of the fibre category of
$\mathcal{X}$ over $T$. Then the morphism
$\textit{Isom}_{\mathcal{X}}(x, y) \to T$ is locally of finite type.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
By
Algebraic Stacks, Lemma \ref{algebraic-lemma-stack-presentation}
we may assume that $\mathcal{X} = [U/R]$ for some smooth
groupoid in algebraic spaces.
By
Descent of Spaces,
Lemma \ref{spaces-descent-lemma-descending-property-locally-finite-type}
it suffices to check the property fppf locally on $T$.
Thus we may assume that $x, y$ come from morphisms
$x', y' : T \to U$. By
Groupoids in Spaces,
Lemma \ref{spaces-groupoids-lemma-quotient-stack-morphisms}
we see that in this case
$\textit{Isom}_{\mathcal{X}}(x, y) = T \times_{(y', x'), U \times_S U} R$.
Hence it suffices to prove that $R \to U \times_S U$ is
locally of finite type. This follows from the fact that the composition
$s : R \to U \times_S U \to U$ is smooth (hence locally of finite type, see
Morphisms of Spaces, Lemmas
\ref{spaces-morphisms-lemma-smooth-locally-finite-presentation} and
\ref{spaces-morphisms-lemma-finite-presentation-finite-type})
and
Morphisms of Spaces, Lemma \ref{spaces-morphisms-lemma-permanence-finite-type}.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-isom-pseudo-torsor-aut}
Let $\mathcal{X}$ be an algebraic stack.
Let $T$ be a scheme and let $x, y$ be objects of the fibre category of
$\mathcal{X}$ over $T$. Then
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\textit{Isom}_{\mathcal{X}}(y, y)$ is a group algebraic space
over $T$, and
\item $\textit{Isom}_{\mathcal{X}}(x, y)$ is a pseudo torsor for
$\textit{Isom}_{\mathcal{X}}(y, y)$ over $T$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
See
Groupoids in Spaces,
Definitions \ref{spaces-groupoids-definition-group-space} and
\ref{spaces-groupoids-definition-pseudo-torsor}.
The lemma follows immediately from the fact that $\mathcal{X}$ is a
stack in groupoids.
\end{proof}

\noindent
Let $f : \mathcal{X} \to \mathcal{Y}$ be a morphism of algebraic stacks.
The {\it diagonal of $f$} is the morphism
$$
\Delta_f :
\mathcal{X}
\longrightarrow
\mathcal{X} \times_{\mathcal{Y}} \mathcal{X}
$$
Here are two properties that every diagonal morphism has.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-properties-diagonal}
Let $f : \mathcal{X} \to \mathcal{Y}$ be a morphism of algebraic stacks.
Then
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\Delta_f$ is representable by algebraic spaces,
and
\item $\Delta_f$ is locally of finite type.
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Let $T$ be a scheme and let
$a : T \to \mathcal{X} \times_{\mathcal{Y}} \mathcal{X}$
be a morphism. By definition of the fibre product and the
$2$-Yoneda lemma the morphism $a$ is given by a triple
$a = (x, x', \alpha)$ where $x, x'$ are objects of $\mathcal{X}$
over $T$, and $\alpha : f(x) \to f(x')$ is a morphism in the fibre
category of $\mathcal{Y}$ over $T$. By definition of an algebraic
stack the sheaves $\mathit{Isom}_{\mathcal{X}}(x, x')$ and
$\mathit{Isom}_{\mathcal{Y}}(f(x), f(x'))$ are algebraic spaces
over $T$. In this language $\alpha$ defines a section of the morphism
$\mathit{Isom}_{\mathcal{X}}(x, x') \to T$. A $T'$-valued point of
$\mathcal{X} \times_{\mathcal{X} \times_{\mathcal{Y}} \mathcal{X}, a} T$
for $T' \to T$ a scheme over $T$ is the same thing as an isomorphism
$x|_{T'} \to x'|_{T'}$ whose image under $f$ is $\alpha|_{T'}$.
Thus we see that
\begin{equation}
\label{equation-diagonal}
\vcenter{
\xymatrix{
\mathcal{X} \times_{\mathcal{X} \times_{\mathcal{Y}} \mathcal{X}, a} T
\ar[d] \ar[r] &
\mathit{Isom}_{\mathcal{X}}(x, x') \ar[d] \\
T\ar[r]^-\alpha &
\mathit{Isom}_{\mathcal{Y}}(f(x), f(x'))
}
}
\end{equation}
is a fibre square of sheaves over $T$. In particular we see that
$\mathcal{X} \times_{\mathcal{X} \times_{\mathcal{Y}} \mathcal{X}, a} T$
is an algebraic space which proves part (1) of the lemma.

\medskip\noindent
To prove the second statement we have to show that the left
vertical arrow of Diagram (\ref{equation-diagonal}) is locally
of finite type. By
Lemma \ref{lemma-isom-locally-finite-type}
the algebraic space $\mathit{Isom}_{\mathcal{X}}(x, x')$ and
is locally of finite type over $T$. Hence the right vertical arrow of
Diagram (\ref{equation-diagonal}) is locally of finite type, see
Morphisms of Spaces, Lemma \ref{spaces-morphisms-lemma-permanence-finite-type}.
We conclude by
Morphisms of Spaces,
Lemma \ref{spaces-morphisms-lemma-base-change-finite-type}.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-properties-diagonal-representable}
Let $f : \mathcal{X} \to \mathcal{Y}$ be a morphism of algebraic stacks
which is representable by algebraic spaces. Then
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\Delta_f$ is representable
(by schemes),
\item $\Delta_f$ is locally of finite type,
\item $\Delta_f$ is a monomorphism,
\item $\Delta_f$ is separated, and
\item $\Delta_f$ is locally quasi-finite.
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
We have already seen in
Lemma \ref{lemma-properties-diagonal}
that $\Delta_f$ is representable by algebraic
spaces. Hence the statements (2) -- (5) make sense, see
Properties of Stacks,
Section \ref{stacks-properties-section-properties-morphisms}.
Also
Lemma \ref{lemma-properties-diagonal}
garantees (2) holds.
Let $T \to \mathcal{X} \times_{\mathcal{Y}} \mathcal{X}$ be a morphism
and contemplate Diagram (\ref{equation-diagonal}). By
Algebraic Stacks, Lemma
\ref{algebraic-lemma-criterion-map-representable-spaces-fibred-in-groupoids}
the right vertical arrow is injective as a map of sheaves, i.e., a
monomorphism of algebraic spaces. Hence also the morphism
$T \times_{\mathcal{X} \times_{\mathcal{Y}} \mathcal{X}} \mathcal{X} \to T$
is a monomorphism. Thus (3) holds. We already know that
$T \times_{\mathcal{X} \times_{\mathcal{Y}} \mathcal{X}} \mathcal{X} \to T$
is locally of finite type. Thus
Morphisms of Spaces, Lemma
\ref{spaces-morphisms-lemma-monomorphism-loc-finite-type-loc-quasi-finite}
allows us to conclude that
$T \times_{\mathcal{X} \times_{\mathcal{Y}} \mathcal{X}} \mathcal{X} \to T$
is locally quasi-finite and separated. This proves (4) and (5).
Finally,
Morphisms of Spaces, Proposition
\ref{spaces-morphisms-proposition-locally-quasi-finite-separated-over-scheme}
implies that
$T \times_{\mathcal{X} \times_{\mathcal{Y}} \mathcal{X}} \mathcal{X}$
is a scheme which proves (1).
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-base-change-diagonal}
Let
$$
\xymatrix{
\mathcal{U} \ar[d] \ar[r] & \mathcal{V} \ar[d] \\
\mathcal{X} \ar[r] & \mathcal{Y}
}
$$
be a $2$-fibre product. Then the diagram
$$
\xymatrix{
\mathcal{U} \ar[d] \ar[r] &
\mathcal{U} \times_{\mathcal{V}} \mathcal{U} \ar[d] \\
\mathcal{X} \ar[r] &
\mathcal{X} \times_{\mathcal{Y}} \mathcal{X}
}
$$
is $2$-cartesian.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
This is a purely category theoretic statement, valid for $2$-fibre products
of categories over categories and $2$-fibre product in the $2$-category of
categories. Explititly, it follows from the following chain of equivalences:
\begin{align*}
\mathcal{X} \times_{(\mathcal{X} \times_{\mathcal{Y}} \mathcal{X})}
(\mathcal{U} \times_{\mathcal{V}} \mathcal{U})
& =
\mathcal{X} \times_{(\mathcal{X} \times_{\mathcal{Y}} \mathcal{X})}
((\mathcal{X} \times_{\mathcal{Y}} \mathcal{V})
\times_{\mathcal{V}} (\mathcal{X} \times_{\mathcal{Y}} \mathcal{V})) \\
& =
\mathcal{X} \times_{(\mathcal{X} \times_{\mathcal{Y}} \mathcal{X})}
(\mathcal{X} \times_{\mathcal{Y}} \mathcal{X}
\times_{\mathcal{Y}} \mathcal{V}) \\
& =
\mathcal{X} \times_{\mathcal{Y}} \mathcal{V} = \mathcal{U}
\end{align*}
see
Categories, Lemmas \ref{categories-lemma-associativity-2-fibre-product} and
\ref{categories-lemma-2-fibre-product-erase-factor}.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-representable-separated-diagonal-closed}
Let $f : \mathcal{X} \to \mathcal{Y}$ be a morphism of algebraic stacks
representable by algebraic spaces. Then the following are equivalent
\begin{enumerate}
\item $f$ is separated,
\item $\Delta_f$ is a closed immersion,
\item $\Delta_f$ is proper, or
\item $\Delta_f$ is universally closed.
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
The statements
``$f$ is separated'',
``$\Delta_f$ is a closed immersion'',
``$\Delta_f$ is universally closed'', and
``$\Delta_f$ is proper''
refer to the notions defined in
Properties of Stacks,
Section \ref{stacks-properties-section-properties-morphisms}.
Choose a scheme $V$ and a surjective smooth morphism $V \to \mathcal{Y}$.
Set $U = \mathcal{X} \times_{\mathcal{Y}} V$ which is an algebraic
space by assumption, and the morphism $U \to \mathcal{X}$ is surjective
and smooth. By
Lemma \ref{lemma-base-change-diagonal}
and
Properties of Stacks,
Lemma \ref{stacks-properties-lemma-check-property-covering}
we see that for any property $P$ (as in that lemma) we have:
$\Delta_f$ has $P$ if and only if $\Delta_{U/V} : U \to  U \times_V U$ has $P$.
Hence the equivalence of (2), (3) and (4) follows from
Morphisms of Spaces,
Lemma \ref{spaces-morphisms-lemma-separated-diagonal-proper}
applied to $U \to V$.
Moreover, if (1) holds, then $U \to V$ is separated and we see that
$\Delta_{U/V}$ is a closed immersion, i.e., (2) holds.
Finally, assume (2) holds. Let $T$ be a scheme, and $a : T \to \mathcal{Y}$
a morphism. Set $T' = \mathcal{X} \times_{\mathcal{Y}} T$. To prove
(1) we have to show that the morphism of algebraic spaces $T' \to T$
is separated. Using
Lemma \ref{lemma-base-change-diagonal}
once more we see that $\Delta_{T'/T}$ is the base change of
$\Delta_f$. Hence our assumption (2) implies that $\Delta_{T'/T}$
is a closed immersion, hence $T' \to T$ is separated as desired.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-representable-quasi-separated-diagonal-quasi-compact}
Let $f : \mathcal{X} \to \mathcal{Y}$ be a morphism of algebraic stacks
representable by algebraic spaces. Then the following are equivalent
\begin{enumerate}
\item $f$ is quasi-separated,
\item $\Delta_f$ is quasi-compact, or
\item $\Delta_f$ is finite type.
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
The statements
``$f$ is quasi-separated'',
``$\Delta_f$ is quasi-compact'', and
``$\Delta_f$ is finite type''
refer to the notions defined in
Properties of Stacks,
Section \ref{stacks-properties-section-properties-morphisms}.
Note that (2) and (3) are equivalent in view of the fact that
$\Delta_f$ is locally of finite type by
Lemma \ref{lemma-properties-diagonal-representable}
(and
Algebraic Stacks, Lemma
\ref{algebraic-lemma-representable-transformations-property-implication}).
Choose a scheme $V$ and a surjective smooth morphism $V \to \mathcal{Y}$.
Set $U = \mathcal{X} \times_{\mathcal{Y}} V$ which is an algebraic
space by assumption, and the morphism $U \to \mathcal{X}$ is surjective
and smooth. By
Lemma \ref{lemma-base-change-diagonal}
and
Properties of Stacks,
Lemma \ref{stacks-properties-lemma-check-property-covering}
we see that we have: $\Delta_f$ is quasi-compact if and only if
$\Delta_{U/V} : U \to  U \times_V U$ is quasi-compact.
If (1) holds, then $U \to V$ is quasi-separated and we see that
$\Delta_{U/V}$ is quasi-compact, i.e., (2) holds.
Assume (2) holds. Let $T$ be a scheme, and $a : T \to \mathcal{Y}$
a morphism. Set $T' = \mathcal{X} \times_{\mathcal{Y}} T$. To prove
(1) we have to show that the morphism of algebraic spaces $T' \to T$
is quasi-separated. Using
Lemma \ref{lemma-base-change-diagonal}
once more we see that $\Delta_{T'/T}$ is the base change of
$\Delta_f$. Hence our assumption (2) implies that $\Delta_{T'/T}$
is quasi-compact, hence $T' \to T$ is quasi-separated as desired.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-representable-locally-separated-diagonal-immersion}
Let $f : \mathcal{X} \to \mathcal{Y}$ be a morphism of algebraic stacks
representable by algebraic spaces. Then the following are equivalent
\begin{enumerate}
\item $f$ is locally separated, and
\item $\Delta_f$ is an immersion.
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
The statements ``$f$ is quasi-separated'', and ``$\Delta_f$ is an immersion''
refer to the notions defined in
Properties of Stacks,
Section \ref{stacks-properties-section-properties-morphisms}.
Proof omitted. Hint: Argue as in the proofs of
Lemmas \ref{lemma-representable-separated-diagonal-closed} and
\ref{lemma-representable-quasi-separated-diagonal-quasi-compact}.
\end{proof}






\section{Separation axioms}
\label{section-separated}

\noindent
Let $\mathcal{X} = [U/R]$ be a presentation of an algebraic stack.
Then the properties of the diagonal of $\mathcal{X}$ over $S$, are
the properties of the morphism $j : R \to U \times_S U$. For example,
if $\mathcal{X} = [S/G]$ for some smooth group $G$ in algebraic spaces
over $S$ then $j$ is the structure morphism $G \to U$. Hence the diagonal
is not automatically separated itself (contrary to what happens in the
case of schemes and algebraic spaces). To say that $[S/G]$ is quasi-separated
over $S$ should certainly imply that $G \to S$ is quasi-compact, but we
hesitate to say that $[S/G]$ is quasi-separated over $S$ without also
requiring the morphism $G \to S$ to be quasi-separated. In other words,
requiring the diagonal morphism to be quasi-compact does not really agree
with our intuition for a ``quasi-separated algebraic stack'', and we should
also require the diagonal itself to be quasi-separated.

\medskip\noindent
What about ``separated algebraic stacks''? We have seen in
Morphisms of Spaces,
Lemma \ref{spaces-morphisms-lemma-separated-diagonal-proper}
that an algebraic space is separated if and only if the diagonal is proper.
This is the condition that is usually used to define separated algebraic
stacks too. In the example $[S/G] \to S$ above this means that $G \to S$
is a proper group scheme. This means algebraic stacks of the form
$[\text{Spec}(k)/E]$ are proper over $k$ where $E$ is an elliptic curve
over $k$ (insert future reference here). In certain situations it may be
more natural to assume the diagonal is finite.

\begin{definition}
\label{definition-morphism-separated}
Let $f : \mathcal{X} \to \mathcal{Y}$ be a morphism of algebraic stacks.
\begin{enumerate}
\item We say that $f$ is {\it separated} if $\Delta_f$ is proper.
\item We say that $f$ is {\it quasi-separated} if $\Delta_f$
is quasi-compact and quasi-separated.
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

\noindent
In this definition we are using that $\Delta_f$ is representable by algebraic
spaces and we are using
Properties of Stacks,
Section \ref{stacks-properties-section-properties-morphisms}
to make sense out of imposing conditions on $\Delta_f$.
There is an interesting way to characterize these conditions by looking
at higher diagonals, see
Remark \ref{remark-definition-separated}.







\section{Inertia stacks}
\label{section-inertia}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-inertia}
Let $\mathcal{X}$ be an algebraic stack. Then the inertia stack
$\mathcal{I}_{\mathcal{X}}$ is an algebraic stack as well.
The morphism
$$
\mathcal{I}_{\mathcal{X}} \longrightarrow \mathcal{X}
$$
is representable by algebraic spaces and locally of finite type.
More generally, let $f : \mathcal{X} \to \mathcal{Y}$ be a morphism
of algebraic stacks. Then the morphism
$$
\mathcal{I}_{\mathcal{X}/\mathcal{Y}} \longrightarrow \mathcal{X}
$$
is representable by algebraic spaces and locally of finite type.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
The (relative) inertia stack of a stack in groupoids is defined in
Stacks, Section \ref{stacks-section-the-inertia-stack}.
By
Categories, Lemma \ref{categories-lemma-intertia-fibred-category}
there are equivalences
$$
\mathcal{I}_{\mathcal{X}} \to
\mathcal{X} \times_{\Delta, \mathcal{X} \times_S \mathcal{X}, \Delta}
\mathcal{X}
\quad\text{and}\quad
\mathcal{I}_{\mathcal{X}/\mathcal{Y}} \to
\mathcal{X}
\times_{\Delta, \mathcal{X} \times_{\mathcal{Y}} \mathcal{X}, \Delta}
\mathcal{X}
$$
which shows that the inertia stacks are algebraic stacks.
Let $T \to \mathcal{X}$ be a morphism given by
the object $x$ of the fibre category of $\mathcal{X}$ over $T$.
Then we get a $2$-fibre product square
$$
\xymatrix{
\mathit{Isom}_{\mathcal{X}}(x, x) \ar[d] \ar[r] &
\mathcal{I}_{\mathcal{X}} \ar[d] \\
T \ar[r]^x & \mathcal{X}
}
$$
This follows immediately from the definition of $\mathcal{I}_{\mathcal{X}}$.
Since $\mathit{Isom}_{\mathcal{X}}(x, x)$ is always an algebraic space
locally of finite type over $T$ (see
Lemma \ref{lemma-isom-locally-finite-type})
we conclude that $\mathcal{I}_{\mathcal{X}} \to \mathcal{X}$ is representable
by algebraic spaces and locally of finite type. Finally, for
the relative inertia we get
$$
\vcenter{
\xymatrix{
\mathit{Isom}_{\mathcal{X}}(x, x) \ar[d] &
K \ar[l] \ar[d] \ar[r] &
\mathcal{I}_{\mathcal{X}/\mathcal{Y}} \ar[d] \\
\mathit{Isom}_{\mathcal{Y}}(f(x), f(x)) &
T \ar[l]_-e \ar[r]^x & \mathcal{X}
}
}
$$
with both squares $2$-fibre products. This follows from
Categories, Lemma \ref{categories-lemma-relative-inertia-as-fibre-product}.
The left vertical arrow is a morphism of algebraic spaces locally of finite
type over $T$, and hence is locally of finite type, see
Morphisms of Spaces,
Lemma \ref{spaces-morphisms-lemma-permanence-finite-type}.
Thus $K$ is an algebraic space and $K \to T$ is locally of finite type.
This proves the assertion on the relative inertia.
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}
\label{remark-inertia-is-group-in-spaces}
Let $\mathcal{X}$ be an algebraic stack. In
Properties of Stacks, Remark \ref{stacks-properties-remark-representable-over}
we have seen that the $2$-category of morphisms
$\mathcal{X}' \to \mathcal{X}$ representable by algebraic spaces
with target $\mathcal{X}$ forms a category.
In this category the inertia stack of $\mathcal{X}$ is
a {\it group object}. Recall that an object of $\mathcal{I}_{\mathcal{X}}$
is just a pair $(x, \alpha)$ where $x$ is an object of $\mathcal{X}$
and $\alpha$ is an automorphism of $x$ in the fibre category of $\mathcal{X}$
that $x$ lives in. The composition
$$
c :
\mathcal{I}_{\mathcal{X}} \times_{\mathcal{X}} \mathcal{I}_{\mathcal{X}}
\longrightarrow
\mathcal{I}_{\mathcal{X}}
$$
is given by the rule on objects
$$
((x, \alpha), (x', \alpha'), \beta) \mapsto
(x, \alpha \circ \beta^{-1} \circ \alpha' \circ \beta)
$$
which makes sense as $\beta : x \to x'$ is an isomorphism in the fibre
category by our definition of fibre products. The neutral element
$e : \mathcal{X} \to \mathcal{I}_{\mathcal{X}}$ is given by the
functor $x \mapsto (x, \text{id}_x)$. We omit the proof that the
axioms of a group object hold.
There is a variant of this remark for relative inertia stacks.
\end{remark}









\section{Higher diagonals}
\label{section-higher-diagonals}

\noindent
Let $f : \mathcal{X} \to \mathcal{Y}$ be a morphism of algebraic stacks.
In this situation it makes sense to consider not only the diagonal
$$
\Delta_f : \mathcal{X} \to \mathcal{X} \times_{\mathcal{Y}} \mathcal{X}
$$
but also the diagonal of the diagonal, i.e., the morphism
$$
\Delta_{\Delta_f} :
\mathcal{X}
\longrightarrow
\mathcal{X} \times_{(\mathcal{X} \times_{\mathcal{Y}} \mathcal{X})} \mathcal{X}
$$
Because of this we sometime use the following terminology. We denote
$\Delta_{f, 0} = f$ the {\it zeroth diagonal},
we denote $\Delta_{f, 1} = \Delta_f$ the {\it first diagonal}, and
we denote $\Delta_{f, 2} = \Delta_{\Delta_f}$ the {\it second diagonal}.
Note that $\Delta_{f, 1}$ is representable by algebraic spaces and locally of
finite type, see
Lemmas \ref{lemma-properties-diagonal}.
Hence $\Delta_{f, 2}$ is representable, a monomorphism, locally of finite type,
separated, and locally quasi-finite, see
Lemma \ref{lemma-properties-diagonal-representable}.

\medskip\noindent
We can describe the second diagonal using the relative inertia stack.
Namely, the fibre product
$\mathcal{X}
\times_{(\mathcal{X} \times_{\mathcal{Y}} \mathcal{X})} \mathcal{X}$
is equivalent to the relative inertia stack
$\mathcal{I}_{\mathcal{X}/\mathcal{Y}}$ by
Categories, Lemma \ref{categories-lemma-intertia-fibred-category}.
Moreover, via this identification the second diagonal becomes the
{\it neutral section}
$$
e : \mathcal{X} \to \mathcal{I}_{\mathcal{X}/\mathcal{Y}}
$$
of the relative inertia stack. Moreover, recall from the proof of
Lemma \ref{lemma-inertia}
that given a morphism $x : T \to \mathcal{X}$ the fibre product
$T \times_{x, \mathcal{X}} \mathcal{I}_{\mathcal{X}/\mathcal{Y}}$
is given as the {\it kernel} $K$ of the homomorphism of group algebraic spaces
$$
\mathit{Isom}_{\mathcal{X}}(x, x)
\longrightarrow
\mathit{Isom}_{\mathcal{Y}}(f(x), f(x))
$$
over $T$. The morphism $e$ corresponds to the neutral section
$e : T \to K$ in this situation.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-second-diagonal}
Let $f : \mathcal{X} \to \mathcal{Y}$ be a morphism of algebraic stacks.
Then $f$ is representable by algebraic spaces if and only if
the second diagonal is an isomorphism.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Namely, $f$ is representable by algebraic spaces if and only if $f$ is
faithful, see
Algebraic Stacks,
Lemma \ref{algebraic-lemma-characterize-representable-by-algebraic-spaces}.
On the other hand, $f$ is faithful if and only if for every object $x$
$f$ induces an injection
$\mathit{Isom}_{\mathcal{X}}(x, x) \to
\mathit{Isom}_{\mathcal{Y}}(f(x), f(x))$,
which happens if and only if the kernel is trivial, which happens if and
only if $e : T \to K$ is an isomorphism for every $x : T \to \mathcal{X}$
as discussed above.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-first-diagonal-separated-second-diagonal-closed}
Let $f : \mathcal{X} \to \mathcal{Y}$ be a morphism of algebraic stacks.
Then
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\Delta_{f, 1}$ separated $\Leftrightarrow$
$\Delta_{f, 2}$ closed immersion $\Leftrightarrow$
$\Delta_{f, 2}$ proper $\Leftrightarrow$
$\Delta_{f, 2}$ universally closed,
\item $\Delta_{f, 1}$ quasi-separated $\Leftrightarrow$
$\Delta_{f, 2}$ finite type $\Leftrightarrow$ $\Delta_{f, 2}$ quasi-compact,
and
\item $\Delta_{f, 1}$ locally separated $\Leftrightarrow$
$\Delta_{f, 2}$ immersion.
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Follows from
Lemmas \ref{lemma-representable-separated-diagonal-closed},
\ref{lemma-representable-quasi-separated-diagonal-quasi-compact}, and
\ref{lemma-representable-locally-separated-diagonal-immersion}
applied to $\Delta_{f, 1}$.
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}
\label{remark-definition-separated}
Let $f : \mathcal{X} \to \mathcal{Y}$ be a morphism of algebraic stacks.
We claim that
\begin{enumerate}
\item $f$ is separated if and only if $\Delta_{f, 1}$ and $\Delta_{f, 2}$
are universally closed, and
\item $f$ is quasi-separated if and only if $\Delta_{f, 1}$ and $\Delta_{f, 2}$
are quasi-compact.
\end{enumerate}
This is kind of cute and it may suggest a generalization of these conditions
to higher algebraic stacks.

Let us prove one of the implications.
Assume that $\Delta_{f, 2}$ and $\Delta_{f, 1}$
are universally closed. Then $\Delta_{f, 1}$ is separated and universally
closed by
Lemma \ref{lemma-first-diagonal-separated-second-diagonal-closed}.
By
Morphisms of Spaces,
Lemma \ref{spaces-morphisms-lemma-universally-closed-quasi-compact}
and
Algebraic Stacks,
Lemma \ref{algebraic-lemma-representable-transformations-property-implication}
we see that $\Delta_{f, 1}$ is quasi-compact.
Hence it is quasi-compact, separated, universally closed and locally of
finite type (by
Lemma \ref{lemma-properties-diagonal})
so proper. This proves ``$\Leftarrow$'' of (1).
The proof of the implication in the other direction is omitted.
Part (2) follows immediately from
Lemma \ref{lemma-first-diagonal-separated-second-diagonal-closed}.
