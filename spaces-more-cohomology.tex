\section{Introduction}
\label{section-introduction}

\noindent
In this chapter continues the discussion started in
Cohomology of Spaces, Section \ref{spaces-cohomology-section-introduction}.
One can also view this chapter as the analogue for algebraic spaces
of the chapter on \'etale cohomology for schemes, see
\'Etale Cohomology, Section \ref{etale-cohomology-section-introduction}.

\medskip\noindent
In fact, we intend this chapter to be mainly a translation of the
results already proved for schemes into the language of algebraic
spaces. Some of our results can be found in \cite{Kn}.





\section{Conventions}
\label{section-conventions}

\noindent
The standing assumption is that all schemes are contained in
a big fppf site $\Sch_{fppf}$. And all rings $A$ considered
have the property that $\Spec(A)$ is (isomorphic) to an
object of this big site.

\medskip\noindent
Let $S$ be a scheme and let $X$ be an algebraic space over $S$.
In this chapter and the following we will write $X \times_S X$
for the product of $X$ with itself (in the category of algebraic
spaces over $S$), instead of $X \times X$.
