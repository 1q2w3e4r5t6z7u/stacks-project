\section{Introduction}
\label{section-introduction}

\noindent
In this chapter we continue our study of properties of morphisms of algebraic
stacks. A reference in the case of quasi-separated algebraic stacks with
representable diagonal is \cite{LM-B}.




\section{Conventions and abuse of language}
\label{section-conventions}

\noindent
We continue to use the conventions and the abuse of language
introduced in
Properties of Stacks, Section \ref{stacks-properties-section-conventions}.






\section{Thickenings}
\label{section-thickenings}

\noindent
The following terminology may not be completely standard, but it is convenient.
If $\mathcal{Y}$ is a closed substack of an algebraic stack $\mathcal{X}$,
then the morphism $\mathcal{Y} \to \mathcal{X}$ is representable.

\begin{definition}
\label{definition-thickening}
Thickenings.
\begin{enumerate}
\item We say an algebraic stack $\mathcal{X}'$ is a {\it thickening}
of an algebraic stack $\mathcal{X}$ if $\mathcal{X}$ is a closed substack
of $\mathcal{X}'$ and the associated topological spaces are equal.
\item Given two thickenings $\mathcal{X} \subset \mathcal{X}'$ and
$\mathcal{Y} \subset \mathcal{Y}'$ a {\it morphism of thickenings}
is a morphism $f' : \mathcal{X}' \to \mathcal{Y}'$ of algebraic stacks
such that $f'|_\mathcal{X}$ factors through the closed
substack $\mathcal{Y}$. In this situation we set
$f = f'|_\mathcal{X} : \mathcal{X} \to \mathcal{Y}$ and we say that
$(f, f') : (\mathcal{X} \subset \mathcal{X}') \to
(\mathcal{Y} \subset \mathcal{Y}')$ is a morphism of thickenings.
\item Let $\mathcal{Z}$ be an algebraic stack. We similarly define
{\it thickenings over $\mathcal{Y}$} and
{\it morphisms of thickenings over $\mathcal{Y}$}.
This means that the algebraic stacks
$\mathcal{X}'$ and $\mathcal{Y}'$
are algebraic stack endowed with a structure
morphism to $\mathcal{Z}$ and that $f'$ fits into a suitable
$2$-commutative diagram of algebraic stacks.
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

\noindent
Let $\mathcal{X} \subset \mathcal{X}'$ be a thickening of algebraic stacks.
Let $U'$ be a scheme and let $U' \to \mathcal{X}'$ be a surjective smooth
morphism. Setting $U = \mathcal{X} \times_{\mathcal{X}'} U'$ we obtain
a morphism of thickenings
$$
(U \subset U') \longrightarrow (\mathcal{X} \subset \mathcal{X}')
$$
and $U \to \mathcal{X}$ is a surjective smooth morphism. We can often
deduce properties of the thickening $\mathcal{X} \subset \mathcal{X}'$
from the corresponding properties of the thickening $U \subset U'$.
Sometimes, by abuse of language, we say that a morphism
$\mathcal{X} \to \mathcal{X}'$ is a thickening if it is a closed
immersion inducing a bijection $|\mathcal{X}| \to |\mathcal{X}'|$.
By More on Morphisms of Spaces, Lemmas
\ref{spaces-more-morphisms-lemma-descending-property-thickening} and
\ref{spaces-more-morphisms-lemma-base-change-thickening}.
the property $P$ that a morphism of algebraic spaces is a
(first order) thickening is fpqc local on the base and stable under base
change. Thus an alternative definition of a
thickening of algebraic stacks is that it is a morphism of algebraic
stacks which is representable by algebraic spaces having property $P$, see
Properties of Stacks, Section
\ref{stacks-properties-section-properties-morphisms}.
We will use this without further mention.
In particular this allows us to define a first order thickening
as follows.

\begin{definition}
\label{definition-first-order-thickening}
We say an algebraic stack $\mathcal{X}'$ is a {\it first order thickening}
of an algebraic stack $\mathcal{X}$ if $\mathcal{X}$ is a closed substack
of $\mathcal{X}'$ and $\mathcal{X} \to \mathcal{X}'$ is a first order
thickening in the sense of Properties of Stacks, Section
\ref{stacks-properties-section-properties-morphisms}.
\end{definition}

\noindent
If $(U \subset U') \to (\mathcal{X} \subset \mathcal{X}')$ is a smooth
cover by a scheme as above, then this simply means that $U \subset U'$
is a first order thickening. Next we formulate the obligatory lemmas.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-base-change-thickening}
Let $\mathcal{Y} \subset \mathcal{Y}'$ be a thickening of algebraic stacks.
Let $\mathcal{X}' \to \mathcal{Y}'$ be a morphism of algebraic stacks
and set $\mathcal{X} = \mathcal{Y} \times_{\mathcal{Y}'} \mathcal{X}'$.
Then
$(\mathcal{X} \subset \mathcal{X}') \to (\mathcal{Y} \subset \mathcal{Y}')$
is a morphism of thickenings. If $\mathcal{Y} \subset \mathcal{Y}'$ is a first
order thickening, then $\mathcal{X} \subset \mathcal{X}'$ is a first
order thickening.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
See discussion above, Properties of Stacks, Section
\ref{stacks-properties-section-properties-morphisms}, and
More on Morphisms of Spaces, Lemma
\ref{spaces-more-morphisms-lemma-base-change-thickening}.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-composition-thickening}
If $\mathcal{X} \subset \mathcal{X}'$ and $\mathcal{X}' \subset \mathcal{X}''$
are thickenings of algebraic stacks, then so is
$\mathcal{X} \subset \mathcal{X}''$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
See discussion above, Properties of Stacks, Section
\ref{stacks-properties-section-properties-morphisms}, and
More on Morphisms of Spaces, Lemma
\ref{spaces-more-morphisms-lemma-composition-thickening}
\end{proof}

\begin{example}
\label{example-reduction-thickening}
Let $\mathcal{X}'$ be an algebraic stack. Then $\mathcal{X}'$ is a thickening
of the reduction $\mathcal{X}'_{red}$, see
Properties of Stacks, Definition
\ref{stacks-properties-definition-reduced-induced-stack}.
Moreover, if $\mathcal{X} \subset \mathcal{X}'$ is a thickening
of algebraic stacks, then
$\mathcal{X}'_{red} = \mathcal{X}_{red} \subset \mathcal{X}$.
In other words, $\mathcal{X} = \mathcal{X}'_{red}$ if and only
if $\mathcal{X}$ is a reduced algebraic stack.
\end{example}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-reduced-diagonal}
Let $\mathcal{X} \to Y$ be a morphism from an algebraic stack to an
algebraic space. Then the canonical diagram
$$
\xymatrix{
\mathcal{X}_{red} \ar[r] \ar[d] &
\mathcal{X}_{red} \times_Y \mathcal{X}_{red} \ar[d] \\
\mathcal{X} \ar[r] &
\mathcal{X} \times_Y \mathcal{X}
}
$$
is cartesian.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Observe that the right vertical arrow in the diagram is a thickening
by Example \ref{example-reduction-thickening} and
Lemmas \ref{lemma-composition-thickening} and
\ref{lemma-base-change-thickening}.
Hence the projection
$$
\mathcal{X} \times_{(\mathcal{X} \times_Y \mathcal{X})}
(\mathcal{X}_{red} \times_Y \mathcal{X}_{red})
\longrightarrow \mathcal{X}
$$
is a thickening (Lemma \ref{lemma-base-change-thickening}).
Hence by Example \ref{example-reduction-thickening}
it suffices to prove that the source of this arrow is reduced.

\medskip\noindent
Let $U \to \mathcal{X}$ be a surjective smooth morphism
where $U$ is a scheme. Then
$U \times_Y U \to \mathcal{X} \times_Y \mathcal{X}$ and
$U_{red} \times_Y U_{red} \to \mathcal{X}_{red} \times_Y \mathcal{X}_{red}$
are smooth and surjective. Juggling with $2$-fibre products
(as in Algebraic Stacks, Lemma \ref{algebraic-lemma-representable-diagonal})
we see that
$$
R = U \times_{\mathcal{X}} U =
\mathcal{X} \times_{(\mathcal{X} \times_Y \mathcal{X})} (U \times_Y U)
$$
is an algebraic space smooth over $\mathcal{X}$. Moreover, we
obtain a commutative diagram
$$
\xymatrix{
R \ar[d] \ar[r] &
U \times_Y U \ar[d] &
U_{red} \times_Y U_{red} \ar[d] \ar[l] \\
\mathcal{X} \ar[r] &
\mathcal{X} \times_Y \mathcal{X} &
\mathcal{X}_{red} \times_Y \mathcal{X}_{red} \ar[l]
}
$$
with $2$-cartesian squares and smooth vertical arrows.
Since the lower right arrow is a closed immersion, we see that
$$
R \times_{(U \times_Y U)} (U_{red} \times_Y U_{red})
$$
is an algebraic space with a smooth surjective morphism towards
$\mathcal{X}\times_{(\mathcal{X} \times_Y \mathcal{X})}
(\mathcal{X}_{red} \times_Y \mathcal{X}_{red})$. It now suffices
to show this algebraic space is reduced.

\medskip\noindent
The morphism 
$$
R \times_{U \times_Y U} (U_{red} \times_Y U_{red})
\longrightarrow
R \times_{U \times_Y U} (U_{red} \times_Y U)
$$
induced by the closed immersion $U_{red} \to U$ is a thickening and so
it suffices to show that its target is reduced. This target may be identified
with $R \times_U U_{red}$ (the fibre product
being taken with respect to the first projection $R \to U$).  
The projection from this fibre product onto $U_{red}$ is smooth
(being the base-change of the projection $R \to U$, which is smooth
as $R = U \times_\mathcal{X} U$ and as $U \to \mathcal{X}$ is smooth),
and thus this fibre product is indeed reduced, as we wanted to show.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-thickening-diagonals}
Let $\mathcal{X} \subset \mathcal{X}'$ be a thickening of algebraic stacks
over an algebraic space $Y$.
Let $\Delta: \mathcal{X} \to \mathcal{X} \times_Y \mathcal{X}$ and
$\Delta': \mathcal{X}' \to \mathcal{X}' \times_Y \mathcal{X}'$
be the corresponding diagonal morphisms.
Then each property from the following list is satisfied by $\Delta$ if
and only if it is satisfied by $\Delta'$:
(a) representable by schemes, (b) affine, (c) surjective, (d) quasi-compact,
(e) universally closed, (f) integral, (g) quasi-separated, (h) separated,
(i) universally injective, (j) universally open, (k) locally quasi-finite,
(l) finite, (m) unramified, (n) monomorphism, (o) immersion,
(p) closed immersion, and (q) proper.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Observe that
$$
(\mathcal{X} \subset \mathcal{X}')
\longrightarrow
(\mathcal{X} \times_Y \mathcal{X} \subset \mathcal{X}' \times_Y \mathcal{X}')
$$
is a morphism of thickenings. Moreover $\Delta$ and $\Delta'$ are
representable by algebraic spaces by
Morphisms of Stacks, Lemma \ref{stacks-morphisms-lemma-properties-diagonal}.
Hence, via the discussion in
Properties of Stacks, Section
\ref{stacks-properties-section-properties-morphisms}
the lemma follows for cases (a), (b), (c), (d),
(e), (f), (g), (h), (i), and (j) by using
More on Morphisms of Spaces, Lemma
\ref{spaces-more-morphisms-lemma-thicken-property-morphisms}.

\medskip\noindent
Note that $\mathcal{X}$ and $\mathcal{X}'$ have the same underlying reduced
substack, say $\mathcal{X}_{red}$, and so it suffices to prove the proposition
in the case of the thickening $\mathcal{X}_{red} \to \mathcal{X}$.
In this case Lemma \ref{lemma-reduced-diagonal} tells us that
$\mathcal{X} = (\mathcal{X} \times_Y \mathcal{X})
\times_{(\mathcal{X}' \times_Y \mathcal{X}')} \mathcal{X}'$.
Moreover, $\Delta$ and $\Delta'$ are locally of finite type by
the aforementioned
Morphisms of Stacks, Lemma \ref{stacks-morphisms-lemma-properties-diagonal}.
Hence the result for cases (k), (l), (m), (n), (o), (p), and (q) by using
More on Morphisms of Spaces, Lemma
\ref{spaces-more-morphisms-lemma-properties-that-extend-over-thickenings}.
\end{proof}

\noindent
As a consequence we obtain the following pleasing result.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-thickening-properties}
\begin{reference}
\cite[Theorem 2.2.5]{Conrad-moduli}
\end{reference}
Let $\mathcal{X} \subset \mathcal{X}'$ be a thickening of algebraic
stacks. Then
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\mathcal{X}$ is an algebraic space if and only if $\mathcal{X}'$
is an algebraic space,
\item $\mathcal{X}$ is a scheme if and only if $\mathcal{X}'$ is a scheme,
\item $\mathcal{X}$ is DM if and only if $\mathcal{X}'$ is DM,
\item $\mathcal{X}$ is quasi-DM if and only if $\mathcal{X}'$ is quasi-DM,
\item $\mathcal{X}$ is separated if and only if $\mathcal{X}'$ is separated,
\item $\mathcal{X}$ is quasi-separated if and only if $\mathcal{X}'$ is
quasi-separated, and
\item add more here.
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
In each case we reduce to a question about the diagonal and then
we use Lemma \ref{lemma-thickening-diagonals}.

\medskip\noindent
Case (1). An algebraic stack is an algebraic space if and only if its
diagonal is a monomorphism, see
Morphisms of Stacks, Lemma \ref{stacks-morphisms-lemma-hierarchy}
(this also follows immediately from Algebraic Stacks,
Proposition \ref{algebraic-proposition-algebraic-stack-no-automorphisms}).

\medskip\noindent
Case (2). By (1) we may assume that $\mathcal{X}$ and $\mathcal{X}'$
are algebraic spaces and then we can use
More on Morphisms of Spaces, Lemma
\ref{spaces-more-morphisms-lemma-thickening-scheme}.

\medskip\noindent
Case (3) -- (6). Each of these cases corresponds to a condition
on the diagonal, see Morphisms of Stacks, Definitions
\ref{stacks-morphisms-definition-separated} and
\ref{stacks-morphisms-definition-absolute-separated}.
\end{proof}
