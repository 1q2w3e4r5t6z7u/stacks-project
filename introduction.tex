\noindent
Besides the book by Laumon and Moret-Bailley, see \cite{LM-B}, and the work
(in progress) by Fulton et al, we think there is a place for an open source
textbook on algebraic stacks and the algebraic geometry that is needed
to define them.

\medskip\noindent
We expect this material to be read online. If you use an
embedded pdf or dvi viewer in your browser the cross file
links should work (if not\footnote{A solution may be
to download the tarball of source files, extract in a directory,
run make, and use a dvi or pdf viewer locally. Feel free to
edit the LaTeX files and send me your improvements.} please email me).

\medskip\noindent
Please email me any typos, errors you find, as well as suggestions,
additional material, examples, etc.
